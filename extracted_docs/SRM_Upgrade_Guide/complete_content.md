List of necessary tools:

- WinSCP or equivalent
- Putty/SSH
- Remote Desktop

Gather the necessary credentials:

- root/administrator credentials for the servers.
- Access to vCenter to take snapshots and validate vApp properties.

## MySQL

This section describes the requirements for the latest version of MySQL.

MySQL's latest version requires the following ncurses and VC++ versions:

- ncurses-libs-6.2-10.20210508.el9.x86\_64
- ncurses-compat-libs-6.2-10.20210508.el9.x86\_64

For Windows:

Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 redistributable package is required for the latest version of MySQL.

## Pre-Upgrade Health Check Utility Script

This section provides information about the pre-upgrade Health Check Utility script to be used before the upgrade for all vApps and binary-based SRM servers.

For more information about scripts, see the following documents in Dell Support Site:

- Dell SRM Distributed Pre-Upgrade-Health-Check Utility
- Dell SRM and Storage M&amp;R AIO Pre Upgrade Health Check Utility

## Verify environment status

Before starting the upgrade process, verify and document the environment status. It helps you to evaluate the success of the upgrade.

## Check Custom vApp Configuration

Do not install any external packages or software, either by using manual SSH or any other means on SRM vApp servers.

If any custom/additional packages or software is already installed on SRM vApp servers, then do not attempt the System upgrade.

The support executives must examine the compatibility of the custom configuration before proceeding to the Operating System upgrade.

## Check /etc/sudoers File on Each vApp VM

## Steps

1. Run tail /etc/sudoers .
2. The last lines must be:
3. #includedir /etc/sudoers.d   # added by MnR platform
3. If the above line is missing, the upgrade of Operating System Components fails. Download and run the vApp update patch.zip on all vApp servers. For more information, see KB 000061512. It prepares the vApp servers for the Operating System upgrade. If the upgrade is already completed, then running this patch file fixes the vApp and updates the Operating System upgrade components on each server.

## Check vApp Options for Dell SRM VMs

## Steps

1. Select the VM, click Configure tab on vSphere client and select vApp options .
2. Verify that vApp options are enabled message is displayed.
3. NOTE: If your Dell SRM VMs installations are geographically distributed in different locations, the deployment must still meet the network latency limits that are described in the Dell SRM Performance and Scalability Guidelines at Dell Support Site.

## Check Server Reachability

## Steps

1. Log in to the Dell SRM UI and go to the Administration &gt; CONFIG .
2. Click Settings &gt; Configure Servers .
3. Check that the connection is established for all the servers of the SRM setup.

## Verify Reports

## About this task

On the SRM Frontend UI, verify the following:

## Steps

1. Look for blank reports and graphs. Determine if collection errors cause any blank reports. Resolve any issues and document them for later follow-up.
2. Look for broken links and resolve any issues or document them for later follow-up.
3. Validate that topology is working. Resolve any issues.
4. Review the existing backends and database.

Check the following reports:

- Report Library &gt; System Health &gt; Summary &gt; Logical Summary &gt; Backends &gt; Components &gt; Backends
- Report Library &gt; System Health &gt; Summary &gt; Logical Summary &gt; Backends &gt; Components &gt; Databases instances
- Check backend thresholds to verify that there is space to accommodate new sizing.
- Add more additional backends and databases as required.
5. Ensure that there is 5 GB available on the files systems where Dell SRM is installed. Check Report Library &gt; System Health &gt; Daily Dashboard &gt; File Systems .
6. Review and document any customization.

For example:

- Polling intervals
- Timeout values
7. Go to administrator page and verify if all the services are running on each host by checking SYSTEM ADMIN &gt; Servers &amp; Modules &gt; Services .

## Backup the Environment

Ensure proper backup of all the servers in the environment. It includes the Frontend, Backend, and Collector hosts.

It is mandatory to upgrade SRM vApp based deployments to SLES 15 SP4 and this process is disruptive. Ensure to take snapshots of powered off VMs on SRM setup.

Before starting the upgrade, use Discovery Center to export all the SolutionPack devices.

If you encounter any problems during the upgrade, these snapshots allow you to quickly recover. After the upgrade is completed without any errors, you can delete these snapshots.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE:

- If a VMware snapshot of each VM is not allowed, you should completely power cycle the vApps and/or VMs before starting the upgrade. Notify all users not to log in during the upgrade.
- Due to the addition of fields Secure Vault and Unique Key in the Manage Discovery page, the older CSV files that are used for devices will not work. To import devices in Discovery Center, use the new CSV template from the Discovery Center and move the data from old CSV files to the new template.
- The fields Secure Vault and Unique Key should not be left empty in the CSV files during import. Use the default value * for Unique Key and false for Secure Vault , in case the values are not available.

For more information about backup system, see the following guides in Dell Support Site:

- Dell SRM: Backing Up with VMware vSphere Data Protection Advanced 5.8
- Dell SRM: vApp Backup and Restore Using Dell EMC NetWorker.
- Dell SRM: Backing up with Dell EMC Avamar 7.1.
- Dell SRM: vApp Backup and Restore Using IBM Tivoli Storage Manager.
- Dell SRM: vApp Backup and Restore Using Symantec NetBackup.
- Dell SRM: vApp Backup and Restore using Commvault Simpana Virtual Server Protection.

The above pointers are available in the Dell SRM 4.10.0.0 Advanced Configuration Guide at Dell Support Site.

## Backup Firewall

- After OS Upgrade to SLES 15 SP4, SuSEfirewall2 is replaced by Firewalld.

All the custom firewall settings will be lost.

- Save or export any custom firewall settings. Reapply the firewall settings post Operating System Upgrade.
- Take a backup on all the vApp VMs.

## Set Java Certificates

If you have previously imported your LDAP SSL certificates, Dell Technologies recommends that you allow the upgrade to overwrite the certificates.

You can import the certificates again using the new method (described in the Communication security settings section of the Dell M&amp;R Security Configuration Guide, which is available from the Dell Support Site). The new method improves overall security as any changes to the default trust store that ships with Java and is reflected in your environment.

If you cannot import the certificates using this new method, migrate the certificates manually, but you get the benefits of the new method.

## Saving the Java certificates file

## About this task

If you have previously imported your LDAP SSL certificates, Dell Technologies recommends that you allow the upgrade to overwrite the certificates. After this, you can import the certificates again using the new method (described in the "Communication security settings" section of the Dell M&amp;R Security Configuration Guide , which is available from the Dell Support Site). The new method survives upgrades, and improves overall security as any changes to the default trust store that ships with Java and is reflected in your environment.

If you not able to import the certificates using this new method, migrate the certificates manually , but you will get the benefits of the new procedure. To manually migrate the certificates, save the certificates file before the upgrade, and restore them after the upgrade.

## Steps

1. To save the certificates file before the upgrade, go to this directory: ${APG INSTALL DIRECTORY}/Java/Sun-JRE/ &lt;Java version&gt;/lib/security .

For example, cd /opt/APG/Java/Sun-JRE/&lt;Java version&gt;/lib/security .

2. Copy the cacerts file to a safe place. (Do not use the Java installation directory as the new installation deletes and replaces it .)

For example, cp cacerts /var/tmp/cacerts .

## Import Java Certificates

If you are upgrading from 3.7.x or later, use the new method to import certificates into the trust store for use in LDAP, device discovery, or other secure communication. If you are leveraging SSL communications and have previously imported certificates into the product to enable this, you must perform a one-time operation to reimport them using this new method. Once you have done this, the import will persist across future upgrades.

## About this task

NOTE: If you have already imported the certificates using this method, do not import them again.

## Steps

1. Check to see if there are any certificate files at &lt;APG\_HOME&gt;/Java/Sun-JRE/&lt;version&gt;/customcerts . If there are any certificates, your certificates will be automatically migrated during the update, and you can skip the next step.
2. If there are no certificate files at &lt;APG\_HOME&gt;/Java/Sun-JRE/&lt;version&gt;/customcerts , then any certificates you previously added manually will not persist across the upgrade to SRM 5.1.1.0 You should perform a one-time reimport of the certificates file as described in the Importing custom certificates into the JRE section of the Dell M&amp;R Security Configuration Guide at Dell Support Site.

## Backup Alert Definitions

Take backup of the modified or customized alert definitions.

## About this task

To take backup of alert definitions which might have been modified or customized, follow these steps:

<!-- image -->

- NOTE: If the customization to the alert definitions is done using only threshold values, then back-up of alert definitions is not required as threshold values are retained after upgrade.

Copying the alert definitions does not copy the alerting contexts. To add alerting context, right-click the wanted alert definition in the table and select Configure Options.

## Steps

1. Go to Admin &gt; Config &gt; Alerts &gt; Manage Alert Definitions .
2. Select the folder which contains alert definitions that you want to backup and click Export Selected Definitions . To take a backup of all available alerts, select Alert definitions and then click Export All Definitions .
3. To export alerting-contexts.xml, in versions earlier to SRM 4.3, keep a copy of the alerting-contexts.xml from /opt/APG/ Backends/Alerting-Backend/conf directory.
4. To export alerting-contexts.xml, in SRM 4.3.x and later versions, go to Alerting Frontend UI .
5. Under Local Manager , click Alert Definitions .
6. In the left pane, click Export button. A ZIP file which contains both alerting.xml and alerting-contexts.xml is downloaded.

## Delete Backup Schedules and Scheduled Reports from DPA Server

Remove backup schedules and scheduled reports from the Data Protection Advisor server before the upgrade.

## Steps

1. If Avamar is discovered:
- a. Go to Reports &gt; Report Jobs &gt; Schedule Report , and delete the following reports:
- W4N-Avamar All Jobs Report
- W4N-Avamar Client Configuration Report
- W4N-Avamar Restore Details Configuration Report
- W4N-Avamar Server Configuration Report
- b. Go to Admin &gt; System &gt; Manage Schedules , and delete the following schedule:
- Avamar-1HourInterval
2. If NetBackup is discovered:

- NOTE: The following order should be followed for Operating System upgrades:
- All remote VMs
- Frontend VM

<!-- image -->

## Steps

1. In vCenter UI/vSphere client, access each VM setting and ensure that the ISO file is available and connected as a CD/DVD Drive for all the vApp VMs in SRM setup.
2. Log in to the Frontend appliance.
3. Go to the directory where SLES15sp4\_OS\_Upgrade-Scripts-5110.zip is copied on the VM.
4. Run the following command to extract the file: unzip SLES15sp4\_OS\_Upgrade-Scripts-5110.zip
5. Go to the OSUpgrade directory and list the contents to check on the scripts. The following scripts must be present:

<!-- image -->

Go through the README file for the Operating System upgrade script to know more details about the script.

6. Run the following command to create a list of vApp Remote Servers:
2. SLESOSupgrade.sh -u remoteServer
7. Once the script is started, a CSV list of vApp based VMs will be created in /opt/ADG/osupdate/SRMVMList.csv .
8. Rerun the following command to start Operating System upgrade on the remote servers: SLESOSupgrade.sh -u remoteServer
9. Provide the root password for all the remote servers when prompted after which the script initiates Operating System upgrade on the SRM VMs.
10. Once the upgrade is initiated on all the VM (except the FE), use the following command to monitor the progress of upgrades on the VMs:

```
SLESOSupgrade.sh -s status
```

The output is a tabular format that displays the Server name and the corresponding OS version.

If the Corresponding OS version is "-", still servers OS upgrade is not completed.

11. The Operating System upgrade to SLES15 SP4 is an offline upgrade and hence to further monitor the Operating System upgrade, login to the vSphere Client console for the SRM VMs.

The Operating System upgrade is configured to go ahead automatically and does not require any user intervention.

12. Once the Operating System upgrade to SUSE 15 SP4 is done, a login prompt is displayed on the console.

## Upgrade the SolutionPacks

After you upgrade to the latest version of Dell SRM, you must upgrade the installed SolutionPacks and other Components.

<!-- image -->

- NOTE: For the 4.9.0.0 upgrade, the snapshot metrics related to the following SolutionPacks turn inactive, as the snapshot retention group is modified for these SolutionPacks:
- Dell Unity
- Dell PowerMax
- Dell PowerStore
- NetApp FAS
- Pure Storage
- IBM FlashSystem

For the 4.10.0.0 upgrade, the snapshot metrics related to the following SolutionPacks turn inactive, as the snapshot retention group is modified for these SolutionPacks:

- HPE Nimble
- IBM XIV
- IBM DS
- Dell EMC XtremIO
- Dell PowerVault

- b. Optional: Back up the alerting-contexts.xml file by browsing Configuration &gt; Alerts &gt; Manage Alert Defnitions from Administration. The alerting-contexts.xml file is located under Configuration Files . Copy the entries from the file that correspond to the alert definitions that you want to back up.
3. On the SRM Administration UI, click on CONFIG &gt; Solution Packs &gt; Installed Solution Packs .
4. Click the Update All Components button in the upper right corner of the page.
5. NOTE: If the Update All Components button is disabled, the system has all the latest SolutionPacks, and you can skip the remaining steps.

The Initialization window opens and lists the following details:

- Number of components from SolutionPacks that is updated to the latest version.
- Number of components that contain new features that require configuration.
5. To open the Configuration window, click Next . The left pane lists each of the components that include new features that you must configure. The right pane displays the configuration details for the component with the new features that are selected in yellow. To ensure that the configuration details for the components and SolutionPacks are correct, carefully review the selections, and modify any configuration that is not set correctly. When you have finished configuring a component, click Next to move onto the next component. The following SolutionPack entries must be modified while reviewing the configuration:
- For the SolutionPack for Dell PowerScale, select an existing Frontend web service or add a new service.

## LUN performance metrics collection is disabled by default for Dell VMAX/PowerMax SP

In SRM 4.9.0.0 release, LUN performance feature is supported in Dell VMAX/PowerMax SolutionPack for PowerMaxOS 10.0 array.

## About this task

LUN performance metrics collection is disabled by default.

To enable LUN performance metrics collection:

## Steps

1. Go to /opt/APG/Collecting/Collector-Manager/emc-vmax-hypermax/conf on the Collector VMs where emcvmax-hypermax, or Dell VMAX/PowerMax Solution Pack is installed.

2. Open the collecting.xml file and search for the line with text Unisphere-LUN-PERF and edit as below:
3. Restart collector manager services for the emc-vmax-hypermax Solution Pack (Dell VMAX/PowerMax).
3. NOTE: Before enabling the LUN Performance collection, see Dell SRM Performance and Scalability Guidelines for changes in the collector configurations.

```
<collector enabled=" false " name="Unisphere-LUN-PERF" next="VMAX_PTF_LUN_PURPOSE" config="Stream-Collector/emc-vmax-hypermax/conf/ streamcollector-lun-perf-unisphere.xml" /> To
```

```
<collector enabled=" true " name="Unisphere-LUN-PERF" next="VMAX_PTF_LUN_PURPOSE" config="Stream-Collector/emc-vmax-hypermax/conf/ streamcollector-lun-perf-unisphere.xml" />
```

## Check the Status of Remote Host Services

The remote host services should start automatically after an upgrade. Check the status of the services and restart them manually if they are not running.

## Steps

1. Check that all services have started on each of the hosts:
- a. From SRM Admin UI, go to SYSTEM ADMIN &gt; Servers &amp; Modules &gt; Servers .
- b. For each host, click the hostname.
- c. Verify that the status for each service is Started . If a service did not start automatically, restart the service manually.
2. Click the name of the service.

3. Click Start . If successful, the Service Status changes to Started . If the service does not start, review the log to determine the cause. The issue may be a misconfigured option. Reconfiguring the SolutionPack settings and manually starting the service again can resolve this issue.

## Verifying and configuring the user process limits for vApp and Linux binary platforms

Verify and configure the user process limits for the apg user account on all VMs to a maximum of 512000.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you log in with root privileges.

Set user process limit in vApp installation using script. Follow the instructions in the KB 000184212 to run the script and set the user process limit.

Follow the steps below to change the limit on vApp/Binary.

## Steps

1. Edit the security file:
2. Update the following lines for apg user to change limits from 65534 to 512000.

```
vi /etc/security/limits.conf.
```

```
apg hard nofile 512000 apg soft nofile 512000
```

```
apg hard nproc 512000 apg soft nproc 512000
```

3. Save the file.
4. To verify the changes, type the following command:
5. To restart the services, type the following commands from the /opt/APG/bin directory of the installation:

```
su apg -c 'ulimit -n -u' open files (-n) 512000 max user processes (-u) 512000'
```

/opt/APG/bin/manage-modules.sh service stop auto

/opt/APG/bin/manage-modules.sh service start auto

/opt/APG/bin/manage-modules.sh service status all

## Security Hardening on SRM vApps

There are standard STIG hardening rules that are supported by default on SRM vApp.

For more information, see the Dell SRM Security Hardening Guide at Dell Support Site.

Import or change any custom firewall settings.

## Reset the password for the Compliance Backend module

If the MySQL password is changed before upgrading to this SRM version, the Compliance Backend module becomes inaccessible during the upgrade because the MySQL password reverts to its default value.

## About this task

To retain the changed password as in preupgrade level, follow these steps:

## Steps

1. Log in to the Primary Backend.
2. Run the following command:
- a. Linux: &lt;APG\_HOME&gt;/bin/launch-update-backend-passwords.sh -c &lt;path to Host configuaration file&gt;
- b. Windows: &lt;APG\_HOME&gt;/bin/launch-update-backend-passwords.cmd -c &lt;pathto Host configuaration file&gt;Username: apg|rootNew Password: &lt;Provide with same password as given in Pre-upgrade level&gt;
- c. Host Configuration File: This file has the following format: frontend=&lt;FQDN&gt;:linux-x64|windowsx64 primarybackend=&lt;FQDN&gt;:linux-x64|windows-x64 additionalbackend\_1=&lt;FQDN&gt;:linux-x64| windows-x64 collector\_1=&lt;FQDN&gt;:linux-x64|windows-x64

## Results

For further details, check the Changing MySQL passwords section in the Dell M&amp;R Security Configuration Guide available at Dell Support Site.

## Create softlink for mysql-client dependent library

## About this task

After upgrading to 5.1.1.0 from earlier versions, if the libtinfo shared library is missing, the mysql-client.sh command gives the following error message: The errors can be seen on the VM console for primary backend/ additional backends.

```
/opt/APG/bin/../Databases/MySQL/Default/bin/ mysql: error while loading shared libraries: libtinfo.so.6: cannot open
```

To resolve this issue:

## Steps

Create a softlink using the following command:

```
sudo ln -s /lib64/libncurses.so.x.x /lib64/libtinfo.so.x
```

Example: RHEL 9

sudo ln -s /lib64/libncurses.so.6 /lib64/libtinfo.so.6

## Find and Fix Broken Links in Reports

The Broken Links Detection Tool scans the entire report tree and identifies all report links that cannot be resolved. It fixes links if possible and provides best guess suggestions for resolving others.

## About this task

Reasons for broken links

## Fixing broken links

## Steps

1. On APG page, click Profile &gt; User Settings .
2. Click Custom Reports tab.
3. In the Broken Links Detection section, click Open Tool .

This button launches the Broken Links Detection task. The task runs on the entire report tree. The dialog box that opens shows the results of the run.

The dialog box shows the following information for each broken link detected:

## Table 1. Broken links description

| Column        | Description                                                                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type          | The type of link that is broken. Examples are: Custom reports, Favorites, Pinned, Scheduled, Pregenerated. |
| Name/Location | The report containing the broken link.                                                                     |

As reports are moved, removed, updated, or disabled in the report tree, links to those reports from other reports must be changed. The old links no longer work. Also, pregenerated reports and reports in the My Reports node, such as pinned reports, scheduled reports, and favorite reports are based on links that might be broken when reports are moved, removed, or disabled. Changed UIDs result in breaking links to reports that were linked or hooked to the original UIDs. SolutionPack upgrades that include moved or updated reports can impact links. For this reason, whenever a SolutionPack upgrade occurs, the upgrade process schedules the Broken Links Detection Tool to run after a timed waiting period. If you are sequencing multiple SolutionPack upgrades closely together, the waiting period is moved out with each upgrade, so that the Broken Links Detection Tool runs only once after all the upgrades seem to be finished. You can run the Broken Links Detection Tool on demand at any time.

The tool fixes many broken lines during its execution. These links are known with 100% certainty to be remapped to other locations. The tool does not show the automatically fixed links. If you are interested in viewing them, you can change the logging level of the daily Tomcat log file. For suggested fixes that do not rate a 100% confidence, the tool presents you with the pathname of the broken link, a suggested path for fixing the link that is based on certain assumptions, and a confidence percentage for how accurate the suggestion might be. You can select whether you want to apply the suggested fix, and the tool applies the fix. If you believe that the suggestion is incorrect, or if there is no suggestion that is provided, you must manually fix the link. The following procedure describes how to run the tool and how to resolve the detected broken links that were not fixed automatically by the tool.

Check the suggestion carefully to ensure it is correct, and if not, fix the link manually. â A 0 level confidence rating indicates that the tool could not find any similar report path to suggest. The old and new report path names are too different from each other to be matched. A manual fix is required. |

4. Analyze the suggestion in each row.
5. To accept a suggestion, click the box in the first column.
6. Click Apply Fixes .
7. When a suggestion is not correct or when there is no suggestion at all, manually fix the link as follows:
- a. Click the Go To icon in the Name/Location column.
- b. Use any of the following suggestions to manually correct the link path:
- For Scheduled Reports, Pinned Reports, and Favorites, it is easiest to re-create the link using the User Interface, and delete the outdated report.
- Correct a link manually: Click Modifications &gt; Edit Reports , and change either the incorrect UID or the incorrect report path in the report definition. There are various places in a report definition where a link to another report might occur. Save the change, and return to Browse Mode.
- If there are many reports linking to the same report path, and that report path is not being found, causing many failures for the same reason, consider the following approach: Revert to the previous version, add a UID to the report that is not being found, then upgrade, add the same UID into the report definitions in the new location, and run the tool again. Analyze whether this advanced approach is better than correcting each link manually.
8. Rerun the Link Detection Tool.
9. Repeat these steps until all broken links are fixed.

## View Fixed Links in Tomcat Logs

If the logging level is set to FINE or FINEST , fixed links are logged in the daily Tomcat log file.

## About this task

By default, the logging level does not produce information about fixed links, so change the logging level. More log entries increase I/O activity and can impact performance.

The log file name is catalina.&lt;date stamp&gt;.log at the Frontend server here:

/opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/logs

The configuration file for changing the log level is:

/opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/conf/logging.properties

You can change the logging level and access the log files on the web portal.

## Steps

1. From Administration, go to SYSTEM ADMIN &gt; Server &amp; Modules &gt; Modules .
2. In Logical Overview table, search for Tomcat .

In case of multiple tomcat instances, select the instance on the frontend VM from the search result.

3. To change the logging level:
- a. Expand the Configuration Files blue bar.

- b. Locate the conf/logging.properties file and click the Edit icon on the row.
- c. Add the following line to the end of the file:

com.emc.mnr.links.level=ALL

- d. To enable FINEST logs, locate this existing line:

1catalina.com.watch4net.apg.logging.jul.handler.RotateFileHandler.level = FINE

- e. Change FINE to FINEST .
- f. Save the file.
- g. Restart Tomcat.
- h. Rerun the Detect and Fix Links tool to start capturing the additional log entries.
4. To view the log entries:
- a. Expand the Log Files blue bar.
- b. Download or view a catalina.&lt;date stamp&gt;.log file.

## Deprecated or Deleted Alert Definitions

The deprecated or deleted alert definitions in this release are still present under Alert definitions. These deprecated alert definitions are present in a different folder with the same old folder structure.

NOTE: This is for information only and no user action is required.

## Install Preconfigured Alerts for all SolutionPacks

Some SolutionPacks have alerting components that are not installed during the upgrade, and they must be installed in the same way that they would be for a fresh SolutionPack installation.

## Steps

1. From SRM Administration UI, go to CONFIG &gt; SolutionPacks .
2. Go to the Browse and Install SolutionPacks and select one for which the SolutionPack block must be installed.
3. Click Install .
4. Enter an instance name for the component that is being installed.
5. Assign a server for the related components. In a typical four server deployment, the recommended server is selected automatically.
6. Click Next .
7. Click Install .
8. When the installation is complete, click OK .

## Next steps

NOTE: VPLEX threshold-based alerts are disabled by default. To manually enable threshold-based alerts, go to CONFIG &gt; Alerts &gt; Manage Alert Definitions &gt; Dell VPLEX Alert Definitions . (SNMP-based alerts are enabled by default.)

## Restore Timeout Values

Customized timeout values are overwritten with a default value during the upgrade, and the system backs up the XML files that contained customized values.

## Steps

1. On Linux, run the following command on each server to find the files with values that changed:
2. On Windows, use Windows Explorer on each server to locate the files. After the upgrade, you must manually compare the old files to the new files and restore the values appropriately. com.watch4net.webservice.idle.timeout
3. NOTE: You can configure the idle time out value using the property. The default value for idle time out is 15 minutes.

```
find / -name *old*(year of upgrade)* -print
```

## Edit New Actions Scripts

It states that the Frontend Server where the Actions directory exists may require to be modified to reflect to the Primary Backend Server .

## Steps

In the conf file replace 127.0.0.1 with the primary backend IP address or FQDN:

## Review SolutionPack Block Configuration for Frontend Access

Dell Technologies recommends reviewing the Frontend web service access configuration for some SolutionPack blocks. It is required to ensure correct settings for communication between the SolutionPack block and Tomcat server (http or https, depending on the configuration, for secure site use https and for other http).

## About this task

Perform a review of settings for the following SolutionPack blocks:

- generic-chargeback
- generic-usage-intelligence
- esrs-query-config
- compliance

NOTE: Repeat the following procedure for each of the SolutionPack blocks mentioned previously.

## Steps

1. From SRM Administration UI, go to CONFIG &gt; Settings &gt; Central Configuration Repository .

2. Type frontend in the Search field.
3. Click the row that corresponds to the SolutionPack block that you must reconfigure.
4. Click the checkbox for the component that you must reconfigure.
5. Verify that the value in the Tomcat port field is 58443 (for https) or 58080 (for http), depending on the configuration.
6. Select either HTTP or HTTPS in the Tomcat Communication Protocol drop-down list, depending on the configuration.
7. Click Update .

## Install the Compliance Rules Module

See the following procedure if the Compliance Rule module is not installed.

## Steps

1. From Administration, go to CONFIG &gt; SolutionPacks &gt; Browse &amp; Install SolutionPacks .
2. Click Configuration Compliance .
3. Click Install .
4. Ensure that the Compliance Rules module is autopopulated with the appliance where the compliance backend is installed.
5. Click Next .
6. From the Web-Service Gateway drop-down list, select Gateway on &lt;Primary Backend Host&gt; .
7. Click Install .
8. Click OK .

NOTE: For all the policies which contain the Default Zoning must be Disabled rule and if the rule is in enabled state in the policy, rerun the policy. Go to the SRM Administration UI CONFIG &gt; Configuration Compliance &gt; Policy &amp; Rules Management , right click on the appropriate policy and click on Run Now .

## Cisco MDS/Nexus Switch Discovery

In previous versions of Dell SRM, Cisco MDS/Nexus switches were discovered through SNMP Device Discovery and the Generic-SNMP collector. Beginning with ViPR SRM 4.0, the SolutionPack for Cisco MDS/Nexus includes a dedicated SNMP Data Collection Manager that allows you to discover Cisco MDS/Nexus switches using Discovery Center. The advantage of using Discovery Center is that you can discover all the switches in a fabric by entering the IP address of just one switch in the fabric. In addition, topology and performance polling interval configurations only apply to devices discovered using Discovery Center. If you prefer to continue with SNMP device discovery, you can skip this section.

- NOTE: All Cisco MDS/Nexus switches should be discovered with the same method. Do not trigger discovery from both Discovery Center and SNMP Device Discovery. When a switch is discovered from both Discovery Center and SNMP Device Discovery the switch is polled twice, wasting collector resources. If Cisco MDS has been moved to the Cisco MDS/Nexus SP, then skip this section.

## Export Cisco MDS/Nexus Switches

Export the Cisco MDS/Nexus switch details from SNMP Device Discovery.

## Steps

## Update Capabilities

For devices discovered through the Cisco MDS collector in Discovery Center, SRM 4.1 introduced a new capability that is called CISCO-DEVICE-ALIAS ([DALIAS]) that enables the discovery of Device Aliases that participate in an Active ZoneSet. SRM 4.3 introduced a new capability that is called CISCO-PORT-CHANNEL-MEMBERS([PCNLMEM]) that enables discovery of port channel members.

## About this task

To start polling the new capability after upgrading to Dell SRM 5.1.1.0, complete the following procedure:

## Steps

1. From the SRM Admin UI, go to DISCOVERY &gt; Discovery Center &gt; Manage Discovery click the Cisco MDS/Nexus Solution Pack and then click the row for a Cisco switch.

The Edit Cisco MDS/Nexus window opens.

2. Click Test and Rediscover .
3. After the Test and Rediscover function completes, click OK .
4. Repeat these steps for the switches that are discovered in the Discovery Center.
5. To trigger polling, click Save .

## Brocade Switch Discovery

Beginning with ViPR SRM 4.2, you can discover Brocade switches by using Discovery Center. The advantage of using Discovery Center is that you can discover the switches in a fabric by entering the IP address of one switch in the fabric. In addition, topology and performance polling interval configurations only apply to devices discovered using Discovery Center. If you prefer to go to SNMP device discovery, you can skip this section.

<!-- image -->

- NOTE: Do not trigger SNMP-based switch discovery from both Discovery Center and SNMP Device Discovery. When a switch is discovered from both Discovery Center and SNMP Device Discovery the switch is polled twice, wasting collector resources.
- NOTE: If the Brocade switches have been moved to the Brocade SP, then skip this section.

## Update the SNMP Collections

Learn how to update the SNMP collections and synchronize the configuration. It would be needed only when the devices are not moved to the discovery center for the solution packs Brocade/Cisco/DataDomain.

## About this task

This procedure is required only if the SNMP Discovery is still being used and the SAN has not been migrated to the new Cisco and/or Brocade SolutionPacks. SAN discovery stops if this step is not completed when using the SNMP Discovery.

## Steps

1. Log in to the device discovery web interface at https://&lt;Frontend IP address&gt;:58443/device-discovery . (On the Administration Dashboard, Device Discovery has been renamed SNMP Device Discovery.)
2. Click Collectors in the left-most pane.
3. On the Collectors page, click the checkbox for each collector.
4. Click the Delete icon.
5. Click New Collector .
6. Retain the values for Network interface and Collector Port unless you have changed the port configuration.

7. The Collector IP Address must be the address of the Generic-SNMP collector's IP address where the collection for the SNMP-based discovery is located.
8. On the collectors, click Send configurations to the 1 selected collector(s) .
9. Verify that all the new capabilities are shown correctly against the collector.
10. On the Dashboard, click Discover capabilities from all the approved devices to ensure that the SNMP masks have gone into effect after the update.
11. On the Dashboard, examine the Device Distribution section. If any collectors are not synchronized, this section contains a warning such as 1 collector(s) configuration not synchronized.
12. If any of the collectors are not synchronized, click the Distribute all approved devicesâ¦ button.
13. Click Send the generated configurations on all available collectors .

After you confirm that the collector configurations are synchronized, go through the UI and review the Reports, SolutionPacks, and other features. One way to check that the health of the system is to view the reports in the System Health SolutionPack.

In order for new data to display in the UI, three polling cycles must pass and the import-properties-Default task must have run.

## Virus Scanning Software in Windows Deployments

Running virus-scanning software on directories containing MySQL data and temporary tables can cause issues, both in terms of the performance of MySQL and the virus-scanning software misidentifying the contents of the files as containing spam.

After installing MySQL Server, Dell Technologies recommends that you disable virus scanning on the main APG directory. In addition, by default, MySQL creates temporary files in the standard Windows temporary directory. To prevent scanning the temporary files, configure a separate temporary directory for MySQL temporary files and add the directory to the virus scanning exclusion list. To do this, add a configuration option for the tmpdir parameter to the my.ini configuration file.

## Review Report Customization

After an upgrade, you must decide whether to use a saved reportpack or the new one.

Report customization is maintained during the upgrade (under My Reports), but you must decide whether to use the saved reportpack or the new one. New metrics to a report are not merged with the old report, so you must manually add any new metrics to the old reports.

## Validate the Environment

After upgrading the system, verify the operational status.

## Steps

1. Look for blank reports and graphs. Determine whether blank reports collection errors cause blank reports. Resolve issues or document them for later follow-up.
2. Look for broken links. Resolve issues or document them for later follow-up.
3. Verify that all tasks are successfully completed (except automatic updates and Dell Technologies Connectivity).
4. Validate that topology is working. Resolve any issues.
5. Verify or edit polling periods.

## Verify vApp Linux Operating System is Upgraded

After the upgrade, verify that the vApp Linux Operating System has been upgraded.

## Steps

Ensure that the Operating System kernel version is 5.14.21-150400.24.153-default. If the SRM 5.1.1.0 vApp Operating System does not show the Operating System kernel version as 5.14.21-150400.24.153-default, then the Linux Operating System is not

upgraded. Check the /etc/sudoers file and the last line in this file should be #includedir /etc/sudoers.d # added by MnR platform." If missing, add this line and save. Run the following command to complete the Operating System update.

```
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d   # added by MnR platform
```

NOTE:

This must be checked on each of the SRM Linux Servers.

/opt/APG/bin/launch-vapp-update.sh

NOTE:

Run this command on each of the Linux server where the Linux Operating System was not upgraded.

## Reconfiguring Kubernetes

Reconfigure the collect block and modify the alert consolidation and topology-related settings based on the service's installation location in your setup.

For alerting support, install the newly added blocks alerts and alert consolidation.

## Deleting the ISO Image from Data Store Location

## About this task

After the Operating System upgrade on all the vApp VM (including Frontend) is completed, it is mandatory to remove the ISO image deployed for this upgrade. To do so, follow the below steps for each vApp VM.

## Steps

1. Log in to the vCenter Client and select the VM.
2. Shut down the VM.
3. Right click on the VM and click Edit Settings .
4. In the Virtual Hardware tab, Delete the CD/DVD Drive 2 .
5. Click OK on the Edit Settings pane to close the window and reconfigure the VMs settings.
6. Check the Recent Task pane of the vCenter client and confirm that VMs are reconfigured successfully.
7. Power on the VM.

After the above steps are run successfully on all the vApp VMs, go to ISO image uploaded in the Datastore location and delete it.

## Limitations and Known Issues

The following are the limitations and known issues.

- After the upgrade, on the Report Library &gt; Recoverpoint &gt; Inventory &gt; Consistency Groups report, the Transfer Status column shows that stale data until older metrics become inactive.
- After you update the generic-rsc block, the CPU Utilization % for Linux Hosts may increase rapidly into the thousands. The system starts to display the correct CPU Utilization % when you update the SolutionPack for Physical Hosts. The higher CPU Utilization values are visible in the reports for few days because the report settings show data that is collected over 2 weeks.
- Units (such as GB and TB) may not display in Capacity charts and Bandwidth charts. To resolve this issue, use SSH to log in to the Dell SRM Frontend and run the following command: /opt/APG/bin/manage-modules.sh service restart tomcat
- After the upgrade, the Path Details and Storage Connectivity report for Dell Data Domain is blank.
- For XMS V2 API, the logic to identify metrics has been changed to reduce inactive metrics due to change in xmsip. It would have implications on all existing metrics post upgrade where all XtremIO metrics go inactive and the historical data is not displayed in default reports. New reports have been added for users to access inactive metrics that are related to capacities for array and volume. These reports are hidden by default and are available at Report Library&gt;Dell EMC XtremIO&gt;Capacity . This scenario is applicable only for Dell EMC XtremIO SolutionPack.
- Alert config changes for Port link down results in duplicate alerts. The alerts are missing for some hosts where the part name is same, this impacts the upgrade. The old alerts become inactive, and new alerts are generated based on the fix. To overcome this issue, manually acknowledge the old alerts.
- In upgraded setup, Scheduled Report to a remote location using FTP option does not work as FW\_TRUSTED\_NETS in the file /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 is missing because of firewall changes in SLES 15 SP4. Remote Transfer using FTP to work, Run the following commands in the path /etc/firewalld/zones :
1. firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=&lt;ip-of-ftp&gt;
2. firewall-cmd --reload

Once the command is run, a success message is displayed and a trusted.xml file is generated.

## Troubleshooting

## Resume the Upgrade on SRM Setup

This section provides detailed steps to resume the upgrade procedure on SRM setup.

## About this task

Before launching SRM upgrade from the UI using the Launch Upgrade button, the system prompts for the following confirmation.

<!-- image -->

The prompt displays that all the SLES12 SP5 based servers (both vApp and binary) associated with the SRM Frontend must be upgraded to SLES15 SP4 (Operating System upgrade). User must confirm and proceed ahead with the SRM upgrade.

If a user skips the Operating System upgrades to SLES15 SP4 for a few servers(non- compliant servers) proceeds ahead to upgrade instead of Exit, then the setup would go into an unsupported configuration , and overall upgrade of the SRM setup is not completed as well.

For binary-based SLES 12 servers (except Frontend), the SRM Upgrades would go through although they would still qualify as unsupported configuration, since this SRM version requires SLES15 SP4 Operating System as a prerequisite.

On the non-compliant servers, the following error is shown:

<!-- image -->

The overall upgrade of the SRM setup(containing such non- compliant servers) is aborted, and a prompt is displayed as shown in the below screenshot.

<!-- image -->

Follow the below procedure to troubleshoot the SRM setup, to resume the SRM upgrade process.

## Steps
