In vCenter UI/vSphere client, access each VM setting and ensure that the ISO file is available and connected as a CD/DVD Drive for all the vApp VMs in SRM setup.\n2. Log in to the Frontend appliance.\n3. Go to the directory where SLES15sp4\\_OS\\_Upgrade-Scripts-5110.zip is copied on the VM.\n4. Run the following command to extract the file: unzip SLES15sp4\\_OS\\_Upgrade-Scripts-5110.zip\n5. Go to the OSUpgrade directory and list the contents to check on the scripts. The following scripts must be present:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo through the README file for the Operating System upgrade script to know more details about the script.\n\n6. Run the following command to create a list of vApp Remote Servers:\n2. SLESOSupgrade.sh -u remoteServer\n7. Once the script is started, a CSV list of vApp based VMs will be created in /opt/ADG/osupdate/SRMVMList.csv .\n8. Rerun the following command to start Operating System upgrade on the remote servers: SLESOSupgrade.sh -u remoteServer\n9. Provide the root password for all the remote servers when prompted after which the script initiates Operating System upgrade on the SRM VMs.\n10. Once the upgrade is initiated on all the VM (except the FE), use the following command to monitor the progress of upgrades on the VMs:\n\n```\nSLESOSupgrade.sh -s status\n```\n\nThe output is a tabular format that displays the Server name and the corresponding OS version.\n\nIf the Corresponding OS version is \"-\", still servers OS upgrade is not completed.\n\n11. The Operating System upgrade to SLES15 SP4 is an offline upgrade and hence to further monitor the Operating System upgrade, login to the vSphere Client console for the SRM VMs.\n\nThe Operating System upgrade is configured to go ahead automatically and does not require any user intervention.\n\n12.

To open the Configuration window, click Next . The left pane lists each of the components that include new features that you must configure. The right pane displays the configuration details for the component with the new features that are selected in yellow. To ensure that the configuration details for the components and SolutionPacks are correct, carefully review the selections, and modify any configuration that is not set correctly. When you have finished configuring a component, click Next to move onto the next component. The following SolutionPack entries must be modified while reviewing the configuration:\n- For the SolutionPack for Dell PowerScale, select an existing Frontend web service or add a new service.\n- For the SolutionPack for Dell EMC ScaleIO, select an existing Frontend web service or add a new service.\n- For the Configuration Compliance SolutionPack, ensure the Compliance Backend Instance field value is the same as Instance Name of Compliance Backend in the previous version. Previous name can be found from Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Configuration Compliance &gt; Compliance-Backend under Properties: Instance Name . Typically the instance name is Generic-Compliance.\n6. After you have configured every component on the list, click Next .\n7. The Confirmation window opens and lists all the components that are updated. Confirm that all the components are listed correctly, and then click Update .\n8. The Update window opens and displays the progress of each update, and the percentage complete of the overall update. Do not close the browser window during this step.\n\nThe update process detects if any manual edits were made to the SolutionPack files. If a manually edited file is compatible with the new version of the SolutionPack, it is reused and the system displays a message, stating that if a manually edited file is not compatible with the new version of the SolutionPack, the system backs up the file to display a warning message. The warning message indicates the name and location of the incompatible file. The backed-up files are saved in their current directory with the following format: &lt;file-name&gt;-old-&lt;version&gt;\\_&lt;date&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;\n\nMessages about the following incompatible files can be ignored:\n\n- tmsconfig.xml\n- snmp-masks.xml\n- slave-snmp-poller.xml\n- emc-vmax-mapping.xml\n- vnxalerts-block-deviceid-&lt;ID&gt;-laststarttime.xml\n- vnxalerts-file-deviceid-&lt;ID&gt;-laststarttime.xml\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9. The Results window opens. Use the drop-down list to check the status of each component. Any manually edited files that the system takes back up are displayed under Updated with warnings .\n10. Verify that all the services are running on each host by checking System Admin &gt; Servers &amp; Modules &gt; Services from Administration.\n11. Restart the Tomcat service:\n- a. Putty in to the Dell SRM Frontend server.\n- b. Go to the cd /opt/APG/bin directory.\n- c. Run the following command: ./manage-modules.sh service restart tomcat for UNIX or managemodules.cmd service restart tomcat for Windows\n12. In Windows deployments, the Java module is updated during the upgrade, but the old version of Java is not removed. Dell Technologies recommends that you remove the older version of Java. Only the latest Java version folder should be kept. Remove the Java files as described in this message:\n8. NOTE: Please check in the Release Notes if any new module or solution pack is added/introduced in this current release or the recent releases after your base SRM versions. If yes, then\n- For any new module of the respective Solution pack, follow the Solution Pack Installation process.\n- For any new Solution pack, follow the Solution Pack Installation process.\n\n```\nSome files were left behind after the update of Java... Please manually remove directory <version number> from the path 'C:\\Program Files\\APG\\Java\\Sun-JRE\\<version number>'\n```\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n",

The old links no longer work. Also, pregenerated reports and reports in the My Reports node, such as pinned reports, scheduled reports, and favorite reports are based on links that might be broken when reports are moved, removed, or disabled. Changed UIDs result in breaking links to reports that were linked or hooked to the original UIDs. SolutionPack upgrades that include moved or updated reports can impact links. For this reason, whenever a SolutionPack upgrade occurs, the upgrade process schedules the Broken Links Detection Tool to run after a timed waiting period. If you are sequencing multiple SolutionPack upgrades closely together, the waiting period is moved out with each upgrade, so that the Broken Links Detection Tool runs only once after all the upgrades seem to be finished. You can run the Broken Links Detection Tool on demand at any time.\n\nThe tool fixes many broken lines during its execution. These links are known with 100% certainty to be remapped to other locations. The tool does not show the automatically fixed links. If you are interested in viewing them, you can change the logging level of the daily Tomcat log file. For suggested fixes that do not rate a 100% confidence, the tool presents you with the pathname of the broken link, a suggested path for fixing the link that is based on certain assumptions, and a confidence percentage for how accurate the suggestion might be. You can select whether you want to apply the suggested fix, and the tool applies the fix. If you believe that the suggestion is incorrect, or if there is no suggestion that is provided, you must manually fix the link. The following procedure describes how to run the tool and how to resolve the detected broken links that were not fixed automatically by the tool.\n\n<!-- image -->\n",

Click the Go To icon in the Name/Location column.\n- b. Use any of the following suggestions to manually correct the link path:\n- For Scheduled Reports, Pinned Reports, and Favorites, it is easiest to re-create the link using the User Interface, and delete the outdated report.\n- Correct a link manually: Click Modifications &gt; Edit Reports , and change either the incorrect UID or the incorrect report path in the report definition. There are various places in a report definition where a link to another report might occur. Save the change, and return to Browse Mode.\n- If there are many reports linking to the same report path, and that report path is not being found, causing many failures for the same reason, consider the following approach: Revert to the previous version, add a UID to the report that is not being found, then upgrade, add the same UID into the report definitions in the new location, and run the tool again. Analyze whether this advanced approach is better than correcting each link manually.\n8. Rerun the Link Detection Tool.\n9. Repeat these steps until all broken links are fixed.\n",

On the Dashboard, examine the Device Distribution section. If any collectors are not synchronized, this section contains a warning such as 1 collector(s) configuration not synchronized.\n12. If any of the collectors are not synchronized, click the Distribute all approved devicesâ¦ button.\n13. Click Send the generated configurations on all available collectors .\n\nAfter you confirm that the collector configurations are synchronized, go through the UI and review the Reports, SolutionPacks, and other features. One way to check that the health of the system is to view the reports in the System Health SolutionPack.\n\nIn order for new data to display in the UI, three polling cycles must pass and the import-properties-Default task must have run.\n",

User must confirm and proceed ahead with the SRM upgrade.\n\nIf a user skips the Operating System upgrades to SLES15 SP4 for a few servers(non- compliant servers) proceeds ahead to upgrade instead of Exit, then the setup would go into an unsupported configuration , and overall upgrade of the SRM setup is not completed as well.\n\nFor binary-based SLES 12 servers (except Frontend), the SRM Upgrades would go through although they would still qualify as unsupported configuration, since this SRM version requires SLES15 SP4 Operating System as a prerequisite.\n\nOn the non-compliant servers, the following error is shown:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe overall upgrade of the SRM setup(containing such non- compliant servers) is aborted, and a prompt is displayed as shown in the below screenshot.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollow the below procedure to troubleshoot the SRM setup, to resume the SRM upgrade process.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Run Operating System upgrades to SLES 15 SP4 for all the noncompliant servers (both vApp and Binary). For vApp based servers, follow the methods provided earlier in this Guide. For binary SLES 12 servers, contact the Administrator for Operating System upgrades.\n2. Ensure that all the servers with SLES12 SP5 Operating System must be upgraded to SLES15 SP4 Operating System.\n3. If the overall Upgrade did not finish on the UI, log in to the Frontend VM with root credentials.\n4. Find out the Update manager process, and kill the same.\n\nOn Linux machines, find the process number and then use the kill command.\n\nps -ef | grep -i update kill -9 &lt;process number&gt;\n\nOn windows FE, kill the process with the image name as java.exe .\n\n5. Restart all services on the Frontend including Tomcat.\n\nTo perform this task, go to the following directories.\n\n- Linux command: cd /opt/APG/bin\n- Windows command: cd Program Files/APG/bin\n6. To restart the services, use the following commands.\n- Linux command: manage-modules.sh service restart all\n- Windows command: manage-modules.cmd service restart all\n7. Log in to the Primary Backend, Additional Backend using root/administrator credentials. Perform the above steps to restart all services.\n8. Log in to the SRM UI and then restart all services across the collector servers. Restart the services.\n- NOTE: Following the above steps, restart the SRM setup again. Now ensure to follow the below steps to restart the upgrade process.\n9. Log in to the SRM Admin UI. On the admin UI page, go to SYSTEM ADMIN &gt; System Operations &gt; Update System to launch SRM upgrade.\n",
