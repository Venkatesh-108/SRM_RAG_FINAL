## Dell SRM virtual appliance installation overview

You can install Dell SRM as a virtual appliance (vApp) in a supported VMware environment. This guide describes the deployment process using the vSphere vCenter Client. The Dell SRM vApp can also be installed using the vSphere Web-based Client, but the details are different and not in this guide.

The vApp is based on SuSE Enterprise SLES 15 SP4.

The product includes the latest version of MySQL Community Server (GPL).

Do not add any binary VMs into the vApp container (including any Dell SRM binary VMs).

The procedures enable you to install two types of software:

- NOTE: The password policy suggests using passwords with more than 14 characters in length.
- NOTE: For vApp based and SLES-based binary SRM deployments, SRM 5.1.0.0 is supported only on SLES 15 SP4.
- NOTE: SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 guest operating system option is not available in Hardware version 13 (ESXi 6.5) and earlier.
- NOTE: In upgraded setup, Scheduled Report to a remote location using FTP option will not work as FW\_TRUSTED\_NETS in the file /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 will be missing because of firewall changes in SLES 15 SP4.

Remote Transfer using FTP to work, Run the following commands in the path /etc/firewalld/zones :

1. firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=&lt;ip-of-ftp&gt;
2. firewall-cmd --reload

Once the command is run, a success message is displayed and a trusted.xml file is generated.

## Core software

The core software is a reporting solution that is built on a scalable architecture of backends frontends, and distributed collectors. When you install the core software, you establish the foundation for the product, which provides common capabilities, functions, and user interfaces. Besides, the following separate software products are preinstalled with Dell SRM: Dell SRM 4.7 SOFTWARE IMAGE (453-010-807) and SLES 15 SP4 SW GPL3 OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (453-010-808).

## Installing the Virtual Appliance

## SolutionPack

SolutionPack are software components that support Dell and third-party storage infrastructure components. Each SolutionPack enables you to select a specific report in the UI. To learn more about the SolutionPack that Dell SRM supports, see the following documents:

- Dell SRM Support Matrix
- Dell SRM Release Notes
- Dell SRM SolutionPack Guide

Dell SRM vApps are distributed using Open Virtualization Format (.ovf) files. Depending on the environment requirements, use the 4VM vApp .OVF or the 1VM vApp .ovf files.

## 4VM vApp OVF

## 1VM vApp OVF

Enables you to install four VMs (Frontend, Primary Backend, Additional Backend, and one Collector). ADG directory that is used by the auto configuration process of the vApp VMs includes a vApp VM. The 4VM vApp automatically configures the Collector host to have 48 GB of memory and 8 CPUs. The following SolutionPack are preinstalled on the Collector host:

- Brocade FC Switch
- Cisco MDS/Nexus
- Dell PowerScale
- Dell Unity/VNX/VNXe
- Dell EMC VMAX
- Dell VMAX/PowerMax
- VMware vSphere and vSAN
- Dell VPLEX
- Dell EMC XtremIO
- Block Chargeback
- System Health
- Configuration Compliance

Enables you to install a single vApp VM. The options are Frontend, Primary Backend, Additional Backend, Collector, and All-in-One. You can use this option to install additional Collectors and Additional Backend VMs to scale out the existing Dell SRM installation. You can add a single vApp VM (Collector or Additional Backend) to an existing vApp container that was created with the 4VM vApp. When you restart the vApp container, the new VMs are autoconfigured into Dell SRM. The auto configuration process includes an ADG directory that is used by vApp VMs. You can also use the 1VM vApp for small All-In-One proof of concept solutions.

The Collector host that is deployed with the 1VM is configured with 48 GB of memory and 8 CPUs.

Dell SRM vApp VMs have properties that are used to configure the host level networking information. If the vApp VM/folder has to be moved from one vCenter to another, you must use the vCenter export and import procedure. Do not use the vCenter remove from inventory method. For additional details, see Guidelines for Managing VMware vApp Solutions (h15461).

Dell SRM vApps fully support the VM vMotion and Storage vMotion DRS functions within the ESX clusters of vCenter.

NOTE: vApp deployments on VMware vSphere 8.0.1 requires a work around. See Deployment of customized OVA on vCenter 8.0 is missing IP address field under Networking section (93677)

## Dell SRM vApp deployment process flow

You can install Dell SRM as a virtual appliance (vApp) in a supported VMware environment.

The following figure depicts the vApp deployment workflow.

Figure 1. Dell SRM vApp deployment process flow

<!-- image -->

## Customizing vApp Configuration

This section provides information about custom vApp configuration.

Do not install any external packages or software, either by using manual ssh/rpm/zypper or any other means on newly shipped SRM vApp servers.

To install external packages/ software on the servers, it is mandatory to reach out to the support executives for assessment of software and operation system compatibility with vApp and any other recommendations for usage.

- NOTE: There are known limitations regarding Operating system and hence, customizing the vApp could lead to certain Operating system functionality problems.

## Installing the 4VM vApp

You can deploy the Dell SRM 4VM appliance from an OVF template using a vCenter Client. The installer creates the vApp container and deploys 4 vApp VMs (Frontend, Primary Backend, Additional Backend, and one Collector) inside the vApp container.

## Prerequisites

- Gather the following information:
- vCenter location where you plan to deploy the appliance.
- A single DataStore is needed for deployment. After completing the deployment, you can use Storage vMotion to move the VM's storage to different DataStores. Dell provides the final storage size per VM.
- Static IP address for each VM: This IP address must be registered in DNS with forward and reverse lookup before you begin the deployment.
- Gateway
- Netmask
- DNS servers
- Domain search strings. For a distributed Dell SRM environment, the domains for all the Dell SRM servers must be entered for each of the Dell SRM servers.

NOTE: While deploying, SRM 4VM vApp do not use underscore(\_) in the SRM host names.

## Steps

1. Browse to the Support by Product (Dell Support) page for Dell SRM .
2. Click Downloads .
3. Download the Dell SRM &lt;version number&gt; vApp Deployment Zip file.

Each download has a checksum number. Copy the checksum number and validate the integrity of the file using an MD5 checksum utility.

The host being connected to the vCenter should be local to the ESXi servers for the quickest deployment. Locate the 4VM OVF deployment file on the host running the vCenter client or place the files on the DataStore.

4. Open vCenter Client and connect to the vCenter Server that manages the VMware environment.

Do not run vCenter Client on a VPN connection.

For the fastest deployment time, the host running vCenter Client should be local to the ESXi servers.

5. Select where in the vCenter ESXi cluster/server you want to deploy the VMs for Dell SRM.
6. Select File &gt; Deploy OVF Template .
7. In the Source step, locate the *4VM\_vApp.ovf and system.vmdk file.
8. Click Next

.

9. In the OVF Template Details step, review the details of the loaded .OVF file, and then click Next .
10. In the End User License Agreement step, review the license agreement. Click Accept , and then click Next .
11. In the Name and Location step:
- a. Specify a new name or accept the default name for the appliance.
- b. Specify an inventory location for the appliance in the VMware environment.
- c. Click Next .
12. Select the Resource Pool or the folder where the deployment places the Dell SRM VMs, and click Next in the Resource Pool step.
13. In the Storage step, select the destination storage (DataStore) for the virtual machine files and click Next . The compatibility window states if there is insufficient disk space on the selected DataStore, and a warning is displayed

when you click Next .

14. In the Disk Format step, select the storage space provisioning method, and then click Next .

| Option                   | Description                                                                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Thin-provisioned format  | On-demand expansion of available storage, which is used for newer data store file systems. |
| Thick-provisioned format | Appliance storage that is allocated immediately and reserved as a block.                   |

<!-- image -->

NOTE: Dell SRM is fully supported on thin-provisioned storage at the array or virtualization level. Thin on thin is acceptable, but not recommended.

15. In the Network Mapping step, select a destination network for all of the VMs, and then click Next . With SRM 4.2 onwards, the only option is to place all 4 VMs on the same ESX server network. It is known as the simplified

network deployment.

16. In the IP Address Allocation step, choose the IP allocation policy and IP protocol to use, and then click Next .
17. In the Properties step, provide the values for each of the VMs, and then click Next .
18. In the Ready to Complete step, review the list of properties for the appliance, and then click Finish . A pop-up window opens in vCenter Client showing the deployment progress.
19. After the 4VM deployment finishes, in the Deployment Completed Successfully dialog box, click Close .
20. Before you power on the vApp, make the following changes to the VM configurations:
- To expand the file system, add additional VMDK disks.
- Adjust the vCPU and VM Memory as specified in the Dell SRM design.
21. Use the 1VM OVF to add any Additional Backend VMs and Collector VMs as described in the following section:

## Install additional Dell SRM vApp VMs overview

You can scale Dell SRM larger by adding additional databases (Additional Backends), Collectors, and slave Frontends. Deploying additional VMs are required to scale the Dell SRM environment. This process includes adding Additional Backend and Collector VMs to the existing Dell SRM vApp container and deploying Collector vApp VMs in different data centers.

For POC and lab installs, an All-In-One solution is available. (The All-In-One solution is not supported for managing production environments because it does not scale.)

The vApp is based on SuSE Enterprise SLES 15 SP4.

The product includes the latest version of MySQL Community Server (GPL).

Do not add any binary VMs into the vApp container (including any Dell SRM binary VMs).

The procedures enable you to install two types of software:

## SolutionPacks

Software components that support Dell and third-party storage infrastructure components. Each SolutionPack enables you to select a specific report in the UI. To learn more about the SolutionPacks that Dell SRM supports, see the following documents:

- Dell SRM Support Matrix
- Dell SRM Release Notes
- Dell SRM SolutionPack Guide

Dell SRM vApps are distributed using Open Virtualization Format (.ovf) files. Use the 1VM vApp OVF files to scale out Additional Backends, Collectors, and Frontends.

## 1VM vApp OVF

Enables you to install a single vApp VM. The options are All-in-one, Frontend, Additional Backend, Collector, and Minimal . You can use this option to install additional Collectors and Additional Backend VMs to scale out the existing Dell SRM installation. You can add a single vApp VM (Collector or Additional Backend) to an existing vApp container that was created with the 4VM vApp. When you restart the vApp container, the new VMs are automatically configured into Dell SRM. vApp VMs include an ADG directory that the automatic configuration process uses.

Dell SRM vApp VMs have properties that are used to configure the host level networking information. If the vApp VM/folder has to be moved from one vCenter to another, you must use the vCenter export and import procedure. Do not use the vCenter remove from inventory method.

Dell SRM vApps fully support the VM vMotion and Storage vMotion DRS functions of vCenter.

## Deploy Scaleout VMs in Existing vApp

Dell SRM supports adding additional backends and collectors either inside or outside of the SRM vApp. Use this procedure to deploy scaleout VMs inside of the SRM vApp.

## Prerequisites

1. Log in to the vCenter managing the vApp you want to scale out.
2. Right-click the vApp and select Shut Down . Wait for all VMs in the vApp to shut down completely.

## Steps

1. Browse to the Support by Product page for Dell SRM (Dell Support Page) page.
2. Click Downloads .
3. Download the Dell SRM &lt;version number&gt; vApp Deployment Zip file.

The host being connected to the vCenter should be local to the ESX servers for the quickest deployment. Locate the 1VM OVF deployment file on the host running the vCenter client or place the files on the DataStore.

4. Open the vSphere Client and connect to the vCenter Server that manages the VMware environment.
5. Select the resource pool where you want to deploy the VMs for Dell SRM.
6. Select File &gt; Deploy OVF Template .
7. In the Source step, locate the 1VM OVF file.
8. Click Next .

## Results

For Collectors installed in a remote datacenter, you are required to use the Dell SRM UI to make some configuration changes to the Load Balancer Connectors, generic-rsc, and generic-snmp installed on each Collector.

## Post deployment, pre-startup tasks

After you have deployed the vApp VMs, but before you start Dell SRM, you must make some configuration changes as specified in the Dell SRM design that is provided by Dell.

## About this task

To complete the configuration changes:

## Steps

1. Adjust the Collector VM memory.
2. Adjust the Collector VM CPUs.
3. To conform to naming policies, change the vApp VM name in vCenter.
4. Increase the VM storage per VM.
5. Move the vApp VM storage to its assigned datastore.
6. Modify the vApp container startup order.

## Adjusting the VMs

The Collectors (and possibly the Frontend) need the number of CPUs, the size, and the memory adjusted based on the Dell SRM design. To make these updates, edit the settings of each Collector vApp VM.

## Steps

1. Change the vApp VMs name to default VM to meet VM naming standards.
2. Edit the VM settings and select the Options tab to make the updates.

## Adding disk space

All vApp VMs are deployed with 132 GB of storage. Each Dell SRM VM needs larger storage. The total Dell SRM VM storage size is based on the Dell SRM design. Edit the settings of each vApp VM and add a VMDK (virtual machine disk). Subtract 132 GB from the total storage size that is specified in the sizing plan that is provided by Dell, and add a VMDK (virtual machine disk) with the size of the additional storage needed. The VM can be running during this process.

## Steps

1. From the vCenter Console, select the individual VM where you want to add new disk storage.
2. Select Edit Settings on the virtual machine and click Add .
3. Select Hard Disk and click Next .
4. Select Create a new virtual disk and click Next .
5. Specify the disk size, the provisioning type, the location of the disk and click Next .
6. Specify the virtual device node (the default value should be OK ) and click Next .
7. Review the options and click Finish .
8. After Dell SRM is up and running, connect to the Linux host. You can access a login prompt through the vCenter Client console or using an SSH tool such as PuTTY.
9. At the root command prompt, type the command expand\_disk.pl .

The script merges the new VMDK with the existing files system while the VM is still running. Use the df -h command when the script is finished to see the new file system size.

NOTE: Using this script extends maximum 1000 GB disk space in one execution.

## DataStores

The 4VM vApp deployment places the 4 VMs on a single DataStore. Migrate the VM from this DataStore to its assigned DataStore. The required storage per Dell SRM VM can be found in the design that is provided by Dell.

For reference, the target storage sizes are as follows:

- Frontend - 320 GB
- Primary Backend - 800 GB and larger
- Additional Backends - 1 TB and larger
- Collector - 300 GB or larger

With the VM in a powered off state, use the Storage vMotion feature to move the VM to a new DataStore.

## Modifying the start order of the vApps

Modify the start order of the vApps in a Dell SRM installation whenever you add a vApp VM to the vApp container.

## Steps

1. Right-click the vApp and select Edit Settings .

2. Browse to the Start Order tab.
3. Move the new VMs into the proper group that is based on the following:
- Group 1: All Additional Backends
- Group 2: Primary Backend
- Group 3: All Collectors
- Group 4: Frontend
4. In the Shutdown Action section, select Guest Shutdown from the Operation list.
5. Change the elapsed time to 600 s.
6. Click OK .

## Configuring virus-scanning software

Running virus-scanning software on directories containing MySQL data and temporary tables can cause issues, both in terms of the performance of MySQL and the virus-scanning software misidentifying the contents of the files as containing spam.

## About this task

After installing MySQL Server, Dell Technologies recommended that you disable virus scanning on the directory that is used to store the MySQL table data (such as /opt/APG/Databases/MySQL/Default/data ). In addition, by default, MySQL creates temporary files in the standard temporary directory. To prevent scanning the temporary files, configure a separate temporary directory for MySQL temporary files and add this directory to the virus scanning exclusion list. To do it, add a configuration option for the tmpdir parameter to the my.ini configuration file.

## Configuring virus-scanning software

Running virus-scanning software on directories containing MySQL data and temporary tables can cause issues, both in terms of the performance of MySQL and the virus-scanning software misidentifying the contents of the files as containing spam.

## About this task

After installing MySQL Server, Dell Technologies recommends that you disable virus scanning on the directory that is used to store the MySQL table data (such as C:\Program Files\APG\Databases\MySQL\Default\data ). In addition, by default, MySQL creates temporary files in the standard Windows temporary directory. Configure a separate temporary directory for MySQL temporary files and add this directory to the virus scanning exclusion list to prevent scanning the temporary files. To perform this activity, add a configuration option for the tmpdir parameter to the my.ini configuration file.

## Configuring binary Dell SRM SRM-Conf-Tools

SRM-Conf-Tools are scripts that are pre-installed on each SRM host in the /opt/APG/bin directory. These scripts are used to configure the Dell SRM hosts the same way the vApp version is configured.

## About this task

The SRM-Conf-Tools scripts use an answers file to automatically configure the Dell SRM servers. You can use the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools scripts for the following scenarios:

## Steps

1. Initially configure a Frontend, Primary Backend, and Additional Backend servers.
2. Add new Additional Backend servers to an existing Dell SRM environment.
3. Add Collectors to the Frontend. If a Dell SRM-Conf-Tools script configuration fails, run it again could cause a miss-configuration. Clean up the Dell SRM from

that VM/Server and reinstall the product. Refer to Uninstallation

## Creating the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools answers file

Dell SRM-Conf-Tools is a command-line utility that can configure and add a single server or multiple servers to the Dell SRM environment. Dell SRM-Conf-Tools uses an answers file that you create that includes all of the Dell SRM hosts in all of the datacenters where Dell SRM is installed.

## Prerequisites

- The answers file is case sensitive and must be all lowercase.
- Create the file using notepad++ or the Linux VI editor.

- Name the file srm-hosts .

## About this task

The format of the answers file is: server\_type=hostname:os

- server\_type -The four basic types of Dell SRM servers
- Hostname -The server's FQDN. It matches the setting of the hostname variable in the apg.properties file. For Linux servers, it should always be the hostname plus the domain name (FQDN). For Windows, it could be the hostname (shortname) or the FQDN depending on how the Windows server resolution is configured (DNS, Active DNS, or Wins/ NetBios). A Wins resolution uses the hostname (shortname) in uppercase.
- OS -linux-x64 or windows-x64

## For example:

```
frontend=<FE_host>.lss.emc.com:linux-x64 primarybackend=<PBE_host>.lss.emc.com:linux-x64 additionalbackend_1=<ABE_host>.lss.emc.com:linux-x64 collector_1=<COLL_host>.lss.emc.com:linux-x64
```

This answers file can be modified later to add any new Collectors and Additional Backends. When the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools scripts run, they distinguish new servers from existing servers and make the necessary configuration changes.

Since the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools and the answers file are used for configuring additional servers at a later date, Dell Technologies recommends storing the files in a /sw directory in the / directory instead of the /tmp directory. This action should be performed because the /tmp directory could be deleted at any time.

## Installing and configuring the Primary Backend host

## Prerequisites

- Identify the host that you want to configure as the Primary backend host.
- Identify the hosts that you want to configure as the Frontend, Collectors, and Additional backends.
- Ensure that you have created an answers file as described in Creating the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools answers file.
- Minimum system requirements:
- CPU: 4
- Memory: 24 GB (refer to the Dell SRM design document)
- Disk Space: 132 GB (the final storage size per server is adjusted later)

## Steps

1. The base Dell SRM software and OS updates should be completed as described in Installing on Linux.
2. Browse to /opt/APG/bin .
3. Run the Primary Backend configuration script:
4. Restart the services and verify that they are running. Troubleshoot any service that does not show a status of 'running.'
5. Check the DB grants as described in Verifying MySQL Database Grants. (Collectors do not need DB grants.)

```
./launch-primarybackend-configuration.sh -c /sw/srm-hosts
```

```
./manage-modules.sh service stop all ./manage-modules.sh service start all ./manage-modules.sh service status all
```

## Installing and configuring the Additional Backend hosts

## Prerequisites

- Identify the hosts that you want to configure as the Additional Backend host.
- Identify the hosts that you want to configure as the Frontend, Collectors, Primary Backends, and Additional Backends.
- Ensure that you have created an answers file as described in Creating the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools answers file.
- Minimum system requirements:
- 64-bit Operating System
- CPU: 4

1. The base Dell SRM software and OS updates should be completed as described in Installing on Linux.
2. Browse to /opt/APG/bin .
3. Run the Additional Backend configuration script:
4. Restart the services and verify that they are running. Troubleshoot any service that does not show a status of 'running.'
5. Check the DB grants as described in Verifying MySQL Database Grants. (Collectors do not need DB grants.)

```
./launch-additionalbackend-configuration.sh -c /sw/srm-hosts
```

```
./manage-modules.sh service stop all ./manage-modules.sh service start all ./manage-modules.sh service status all
```

## Installing and configuring the Collector host

## Prerequisites

- Identify the hosts that you want to configure as the Collector hosts.
- Ensure that you have created an answers file as described in Creating the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools answers file.
- Collector to Mega Collector System Requirements:
- 64 bit operating system (Linux or Windows)
- CPU- 4 to 8
- Memory: 16 GB to 64 GB (refer to the Dell SRM design document)
- Disk Space: 132 GB (the final storage size per server is adjusted later).

## Steps

1. Complete the base Dell SRM software and OS updates should be completed as described in Installing on UNIX and/or Installing on Windows Server.
2. Browse to /opt/APG/bin .
3. Run the Collector configuration script:

```
./launch-collector-configuration.sh -c /sw/srm-hosts
```

4. Restart the services and verify that they are running. Troubleshoot any service that does not show a status of 'running.'
5. Because the Generic-RSC and Generic-SNMP modules are installed by default and if you do not plan to use this collector for host discovery or SNMP discovery, you can choose to remove these modules, remove these modules:

```
./manage-modules.sh service stop all ./manage-modules.sh service start all ./manage-modules.sh service status all
```

```
/opt/APG/bin/manage-modules.sh remove generic-snmp
```

## Installing and configuring the Frontend host

```
./launch-frontend-configuration.sh -c /sw/srm-hosts
```

During the Frontend configuration, the management-resources are configured on the Primary Backend server. If the Dell SRM ports are not open, then this configuration script fails with this error: "Some operations failed to run successfully." Review the logs and fix any errors manually. Refer to Updating firewall ports in Red Hat and SLES servers to establish the Dell SRM ports on all the Dell SRM servers. Do not try to run this script again. Remove Dell SRM from the server where you are running the script and reinstall Dell SRM. Refer to Uninstallation

4. Restart the services and verify that they are running. Troubleshoot any service that does not show a status of 'running.'
5. Verify that the Dell SRM management resources have been created:

```

```

3. Copy the apg.xml file to the /etc/firewalld/services directory.
4. To add the ports to the existing firewall run the following command:
5. Check the status of firewalld:

```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=apg
```

systemctl status firewalld

## Editing new actions scripts

## Using the Dell SRM Setup Wizard

This chapter includes the following topic:

## Topics:

- Using the Discovery Wizard

## Using the Discovery Wizard

The Discovery Wizard is a tool to ease the initial deployment and configuration of the most commonly used SolutionPacks. After upgrading to SRM 4.2 or later, you may want to use the Discovery Wizard to quickly enable the SolutionPacks, and add the corresponding devices that you would like to report on. In a few simple steps you can now add the devices, monitor the collection process, and then go to the reports to see the data.

## About this task

These steps use the VMAX 3/VMAX All Flash SolutionPack as an example.

## Steps

1. Log in to the user interface at https://&lt;Frontend-hostname&gt;:58443/APG .

The default username is admin . The default password is changeme .

2. Access the Discovery Wizard from the admin page: Administration &gt; DISCOVERY &gt; Discovery Wizard .
3. On the License page, do one of the following and click Continue .
3. NOTE: To support the XML based license features with SRM, the configuration property must be updated.
- For more details on configuring the XML license property, see Dell SRM Administrator Guide.
- You can add a permanent license by drag-and-dropping the file onto the license box.
4. On the Storage Collection page, do the following and click Continue .
- a. Type the FQDN or IP address of the Unisphere for VMAX host.
- b. Type the login credential and port number.
5. On the Confirm Storage page lists the detected arrays.
- a. Select the arrays from which you want to collect data.

The meter at the bottom indicates how many more volumes you can collect before you exceed the limit.

- b. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue when you have finished adding arrays.
2. NOTE: The Confirm Storage page only applies to VMAX systems.
6. On the Fabric Collection page, select Brocade (SMI-S) or Cisco (SNMP) from the drop-down list. Type the credentials and configuration options for the switch. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue .

Brocade SAN discovery with this wizard is through Brocade SMI-S only. This solution provides limited switch performance and topology information with WWNs. The Brocade SMI-S Data Collector that is deployed with the 4VM Collector is configured to discover everything through SMI-S. When you deploy the Brocade SolutionPack, the SMI-S Data Collector is configured to restrict the data collection to zoning only. It is a best practice to discover the Brocade SAN using SMIS-S for zoning and SNMP for everything else. It provides performance metrics, and the topology shows friendly names.

7. On the Fabric Collection page, select Brocade (SNMP+SMI-S) or Cisco (SNMP) from the drop-down list. Type the credentials and configuration options for the switch. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue . Brocade SAN discovery with this wizard is through Brocade SMI-S &amp; SNMP.

## Dell SRM configuration tools

Dell SRM Configuration Tools (SRM-Conf-Tools) are installed with the Dell SRM software in the /opt/APG/bin directory. These tools work with both vApp and binary deployments.

The SRM-Conf-Tools scripts use an answers file to automatically configure the Dell SRM servers. You can use the SRM-ConfTools for the following scenarios:

- Initial configuration of a Frontend, Primary Backend, and Additional Backend servers
- Adding new Additional Backend servers to an existing Dell SRM environment
- Adding new Collectors to an existing Dell SRM environment
- Before you begin, deploy all the Collectors/ Additional Backends in all the remote data centers. They can be Collector/ Additional Backends vApps, or binary Linux or Windows Collectors.
- Binary Collectors/Additional Backends are installed using the Collector/Backend install option for both Linux and Windows. A Collector/Backend configuration script in SRM-Conf-Tools finishes the Collector/Backend configuration so that it is the same as a vApp collector/Backend.

If an SRM-Conf-Tools script configuration fails, you cannot run the script a second time. If the configuration fails, you must clean Dell SRM from the server and reinstall Dell SRM. See Uninstallation.

If you are using vCenter Snapshots, power off the VM and take a snapshot before running the scale-tools script.

## Creating the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools answers file

Dell SRM-Conf-Tools is a command-line utility that can configure and add a single server or multiple servers to the Dell SRM environment. Dell SRM-Conf-Tools uses an answers file that you create that includes all of the Dell SRM hosts in all of the datacenters where Dell SRM is installed.

## Prerequisites

- The answers file is case sensitive and must be all lowercase.
- Create the file using notepad++ or the Linux VI editor.
- Name the file srm-hosts .

## About this task

The format of the answers file is: server\_type=hostname:os

- server\_type -The four basic types of Dell SRM servers
- Hostname -The server's FQDN. It matches the setting of the hostname variable in the apg.properties file. For Linux servers, it should always be the hostname plus the domain name (FQDN). For Windows, it could be the hostname (shortname) or the FQDN depending on how the Windows server resolution is configured (DNS, Active DNS, or Wins/ NetBios). A Wins resolution uses the hostname (shortname) in uppercase.
- OS -linux-x64 or windows-x64

## Dell SRM Configuration Tools

For example:

```
frontend=<FE_host>.lss.emc.com:linux-x64 primarybackend=<PBE_host>.lss.emc.com:linux-x64 additionalbackend_1=<ABE_host>.lss.emc.com:linux-x64 collector_1=<COLL_host>.lss.emc.com:linux-x64
```

This answers file can be modified later to add any new Collectors and Additional Backends. When the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools scripts run, they distinguish new servers from existing servers and make the necessary configuration changes.

Since the Dell SRM-Conf-Tools and the answers file are used for configuring additional servers at a later date, Dell Technologies recommends storing the files in a /sw directory in the / directory instead of the /tmp directory. This action should be performed because the /tmp directory could be deleted at any time.

## Stopping Dell M&amp;R platform services on a UNIX server

Use the manage-modules.sh service stop command to stop a specific Dell M&amp;R platform service or to stop all Dell M&amp;R platform services on a UNIX server.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have logged in with root or APG privileges.

- NOTE: The list of services varies depending on which type of installation was performed, vApp, collector, backend, and frontend.

## Steps

- Type manage-modules.sh service stop &lt;service\_name&gt; from the bin directory of the installation to stop a specific Dell M&amp;R platform service.

This example shows how to stop all Dell M&amp;R platform services:

./manage-modules.sh service stop all

## Uninstalling the product from a UNIX server

Use this procedure to uninstall the product from the Unix server.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a login with root privileges.

## Uninstallation

## Steps

1. Type rm -rf /opt/APG to remove the installation directory.
2. Restart the server.

## Stopping Dell M&amp;R platform services on a Windows server

Use this procedure to stop Dell M&amp;R platform services from the Windows desktop.

## Prerequisites

To manage services, ensure that you have logged in with system administrator credentials.

- NOTE: The list of services varies depending on which type of installation was performed, vApp, collector, backend, and frontend.

## Steps

Type manage-modules.cmd service stop &lt;service\_name&gt; from the bin directory of the installation to stop a specific Dell M&amp;R platform service.

This example shows how to stop all Dell M&amp;R platform services:

./manage-modules.cmd service stop all

## Uninstalling the product from a Windows server

Use this procedure to uninstall the product from the Windows server.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have logged in with system administrator credentials.

## Steps

1. Use the Windows Control Panel to uninstall the product.
- a. Click Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Programs .
- b. Click Uninstall a program .
- c. Select the Watch4net Solutions APG and click Uninstall .
2. Restart the server.

## Uninstalling a SolutionPack

If you no longer want to view the reports of a certain SolutionPack, you can uninstall that SolutionPack from the server.

## Steps

1. Log in with administrator credentials for Dell M&amp;R platform and select Administration .
2. Go to Config &gt; SolutionPacks &gt; Installed SolutionPacks .
3. Select the SolutionPack that you want to uninstall in the Installed SolutionPacks screen.
4. In the Properties area, click Trashcan icon for each instance of the SolutionPackBlock and click Remove .

## Remove a Server and Delete vApp

If a scaled-out collector is no longer in use, you can unregister from the existing Dell SRM deployment, and remove the vApp.

## Steps:

1. SRM Admin page &gt; Configure Servers &gt; Delete the unwanted server (scaled-out collector) &gt; SAVE .
2. NOTE: There is no confirmation notification for the deletion and the server removes at the instant the bin icon is clicked.
2. Login to the Collector console using root, run # manage-modules.sh service remove all
3. Power off the VM.
4. Delete from the disk.

This MUST only be performed on a scaled-out VM (Collector host) that is no longer in use/required.

This appendix includes the following topics:

## Topics:

- Unattended installation
- Unattended installation arguments for Linux
- Unattended installation arguments for Windows

## Unattended installation

Dell EMC M&amp;R 6.7 and higher supports fully unattended installations, which are particularly useful for installing the software on remote systems via scripts. This appendix describes the installation of the platform software, but it does not include the installation and configuration of modules or SolutionPacks.

## Unattended installation arguments for Linux

- --silent
- Runs the setup script in unattended mode. No questions are asked, and the default settings are used.
- --accept-eula
- Accepts the EULA. By providing this switch, you are confirming that you have read and accepted the EULA.
- --install-dir = &lt;path to installation&gt;
- Overrides the default installation location. The default is typically /opt/APG .
- --user = username
- Overrides the default user for installation of the servers. The default is typically apg.
- --script-directory = initd\_directory
- Overrides the default script directory. The default is /etc/init.d .
- --runlevel-directory = rcd\_directory
- Overrides the default runlevels directory (containing rc[0-6].d/ ).
- The default is /etc .
- --install-type = installation\_type
- Overrides the default installation type. The available options are default, minimal, collector, backend, and frontend. The command only considers the first letter, so --install-type=C is equivalent to --install-type=collector . The value of the parameter is not case sensitive.

## To override the default installation and set the installation type to collector:

[root@server ~]# ./linux\_setup.sh -- --install-type=collector

To run a fully unattended installation and install as a collector in an alternate directory:

[root@server ~]# ./linux\_setup.sh -- --accept-eula --silent --install-type=collector -install-dir=/opt/SRM

## Unattended installation arguments for Windows

- /S
- Runs the setup script in unattended mode. No questions are asked, and the default settings are used. It must be the first argument.
- ACCEPTEULA = Yes

## Unattended Installation

- Accepts the EULA. By providing this switch, you are confirming that you have read and accepted the EULA. If you have not accepted the EULA, the installer refuses to run in unattended mode.
- INSTALL-TYPE = installation\_type
- Overrides the default installation type. The available options are: default, minimal, collector, backend, and frontend. The command only considers the first letter, so INSTALL-TYPE=C is equivalent to INSTALL-TYPE=collector . The value of the parameter is not case sensitive.
- /D
- Sets the default installation directory. It must be the last parameter. It cannot contain any quotes (even if the path contains spaces), and only absolute paths are supported.

## To run a fully unattended installation and install as a collector in an alternate directory:

C:\Users\user1&gt; windows\_setup.exe /S /D=C:\SRM /ACCEPTEULA=Yes /INSTALL-TYPE=collector
