## Key terms

Review these commonly used terms before you begin using the interface.

## Aggregation

Two types of values are stored in the database: real-time values and aggregated values. Real-time values are the actual values that are collected by the collectors. Aggregated values are the compound of several real-time values. Aggregated values improve report performance and save disk space. Aggregated values are created and updated as real-time values are collected. This way, aggregated values are always current and precise. A default installation contains 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 week aggregates.

## Backend

The backend module receives, normalizes, and consolidates the collected data and pushes it to the database. The backend performs data aggregation.

## Browse mode

The Browse mode is the default mode of the user interface. In Browse mode, you can generate and view reports by clicking the report nodes in the tree. In Browse mode, an expansion on a device property appears as one node per device in the report tree.

## Collector

Collectors are lightweight modules that gather time series data from supported devices and configuration items and ingest it into the processing pipeline as raw values.

## Data point

A data point is one unit of data that contains a timestamp, metric, and value.

## Edit mode

In Edit mode, you can create reports, edit existing reports, and customize the report tree. When the interface is in Edit mode, the report tree tools that are used to add, delete, cut, copy, paste, and link report nodes are displayed. In Edit mode, the nodes in the report tree are not expanded as they are in the Browse mode. The report pane displays the report configuration tabs.

## Expansion

Expansion dynamically creates sub nodes. Sub nodes add levels to a report so that you can analyze. When a node is set to expand, the node transforms itself from a single node to as many nodes as there are matches of the specified property name in the dataset. By using expansion, you can define a report that automatically creates and deletes nodes based on the properties

that are found in the dataset. For example, as devices are added to the network, they are automatically added to the report when their properties match the expansion criteria.

## Filtering

A filter is an expression that limits the number of metrics that are displayed in a report. Filtering is vital to configuring a report because it determines the report's dataset. You can manually create a filter when you know which properties and values to include in a filter, or you can use the Filter Wizard to help you define the filter.

## Frontend

The frontend refers to the main user interface that displays time series and event-based data in reports. The frontend interfaces with the database.

## Metric

A metric is a quantity that can be collected and reported on, such as: CPU usage, throughput, and capacity.

## Node

Nodes appear in the report tree. You click a node to generate and see a report. Reports appear on the right side when you select a node. Nodes can have parent and child nodes (sub nodes).

## Property

A property is metadata that is associated with a metric. For example, an iflnOctets metric could also contain information about the device type supplying the value and the device name.

## Root node

A root node is the topmost node of a branch in the report tree.

## What's New in SRM

The SRM frontend URL prompts a pop-up dialog known as New Features once you login. The pop-up dialog lists the new features which are part of current SRM release. You have the option to select Do not display this message again checkbox option in the pop-up dialog, if you do not want to see the dialog again in successive logins.

You can access the New Features page from the Help section at any time. This feature is available for all User Roles supported by OTB in SRM. The SRM admin can disable this feature based on the User Role from Admin UI &gt; Users &amp; Security &gt; Users &amp; Roles &gt; Manage Roles &gt; [Role] &gt; Modules &amp; Restrictions Access &gt; Watch4net Frontend &gt; New Features dialog display . Admin can control the enabling or disabling of this feature for any user from SRM Admin UI &gt; Users &amp; Security &gt; Users &amp; Roles &gt; Manage Users &gt; User Status .

## Browsing reports

Browse mode is the default mode of the user interface. In Browse mode, you can generate and view reports by clicking the report nodes in the tree.

You can do the following in browse mode.

- Examine in most reports to get more detailed reports.
- Change how reports are displayed, including the type of table or graph that is used to display the data.
- Customize the look, and feel of the displayed metrics.

- Change the type of aggregation and the type range of the report.
- Create a dashboard of favorite reports.
- Take a snapshot of a report.
- Print, email, and export reports.
- Schedule reports.

## Navigation styles

The navigation column on the User Interface provides access to all reports. You can choose between the Icon Navigation and Tree Navigation styles. The Administrator sets the default style for the installation.

Default style

Each user account can override the global default style and set their own preferred style in the Navigation Style field at Profile &gt; User Settings &gt; Preferences .

Icon Navigation

The Icon Navigation style helps preserve space on smaller-sized windows. Initially, it shows only a thin column of icons. To browse to a report, click an icon. A second column of categories appears. To expand a category, click it, and click again to select a report. Notice the scrollbar on the expanded second column. The second column disappears when you click a report. To browse further into the reporting structure, use the tabs, dashboards, and links in the reporting pane.

Tree Navigation

The Tree Navigation style can display the entire reporting structure, with multiple nodes expanded at once. Use the arrows to expand or contract the nodes. To display a report, click any entry in the tree. You can also use the tabs, dashboards, and links in the reporting pane to browse around the reporting structure.

## Set default navigation style

The navigation style controls the look and feel of the left navigation column in the reporting interface.

## About this task

This procedure sets the global default navigation style.

## Steps

1. Click Profile &gt; User Settings &gt; Preferences .

2. In Navigation Style

- , make a selection.

| Use tree navigation    | The navigation column is a hierarchical tree of report names.               |

3. Click Save .

## Make icon navigation column static

For the icon navigation style, use the pin to switch the second column between temporary and static states.

## About this task

In its default state, the second column disappears when you select a report. You can pin the second column so it remains visible and the report pane moves to the right to accommodate it.

## Steps

1. Click the pin at the top of the icon navigation bar.

2. Click the pin again to return the second column to a temporary display.

## Displaying and canceling reports

When you browse to a report on the Console, the system starts generating that report using the most recently collected data. If you browse away from the page to another report, the system cancels the first report and starts generating the new report.

Here are some important hovers over remember about displaying reports.

Data collection occurs in scheduled intervals

One report per user session at a time

Scheduled reports generate in the background

Reports in Stored Reports are snapshots, and are not regenerated

There might be many data collectors in the system, each gathering data from different components in the infrastructure. Each collector is configured with a collection interval. Depending on how the administrators configured the various collectors, you might see some infrastructure activity, reflected in reports within 15 minutes, and others not for a day or more.

The Console generates one report per user session at a time. If you browse to another report while the first report is still generating, the first report is canceled, and the new report generation starts. If you are waiting for a long-running report to generate, do not click around examining other reports expecting the original report to finish running in the background.

Scheduled reports do not affect the "one report per user session" rule. If you consistently depend on reports that take a long time to generate, you can put those reports on an automatic schedule, and view them in their completed state whenever you need them. Use Tools &gt; Schedule this Report . You can request that the report be emailed or stored on a remote system. You can request that the report be emailed, stored on a remote system, or stored for Console viewing under My Reports &gt; Stored Reports .

When you browse to a report in the My Reports &gt; Stored Reports node, the snapshot of data from the stored date/time redisplays. The report is not regenerated. You can store a snapshot using Tools &gt; Store this Report , or schedule the report as mentioned earlier.

Searches a predefined set of database properties for a requested value. This search feature returns an organized set of links to the reports that contain the value. To start a Quick Search, type a search

## Advanced Search

string in the Search text box in the banner area, and press Enter . The search string must be at least three characters and not contain wildcards.

Provides a filter for defining detailed search conditions and an expansion field for defining what to return and how to organize the results. To start an Advanced Search, click Modifications &gt; Advanced Search .

In either case, you can view the results in the report window and also in a Search Results node that is created in the report tree.

## Quick search

To perform a quick search, type the search string in the Search text box in the banner, and press Enter. The search returns links to reports about the found values.

## About this task

NOTE: The search string must contain at least three characters and no wildcards.

The search is case insensitive, and finds occurrences of the string anywhere in the property value (that is, at the beginning, middle, or end of the value). The result is a categorized list of links to reports that contain the matched value.

For example, the following search for LGL finds device names containing that value, and returns links to major reports about those devices. In this case, the links are to the device summary reports and to alerts on those devices.

<!-- image -->

The search looks at a limited set of predefined properties in each of the product databases. The following table shows the database properties that are searched.

NOTE:

The categories correspond to databases. The installation might not use all of the databases.

## Filtering a report using group filters

Group filters appear across the top of the report. They present a dialog box of check boxes that let you select multiple values to filter on.

## About this task

The dialog box lists only the values that are relevant to the current report. The list reflects the database and is further limited by the report filter in the report definition. For example, the following filter on the Platform property lists only the platforms that are being monitored at the installation and are relevant to the report definition:

<!-- image -->

Note the following information about group filters:

- If there are no values in a filter dialog box, the installation is not populating that property, or no values apply to the current report.
- In a table report, the values that appear in a group filter dialog box are not limited by column filters that might be in effect on the table. For example, a Situations to Watch report might contain a column filter that eliminates rows that are based on values in that column. In that way, a Situations to Watch report typically contains just a few rows. The group filter dialog box, however, continues to list all values relevant to the entire report, not just to the displayed rows.
- A group filter can be defined for any database property using features in EDIT MODE.
- When a group filter is defined on a data enrichment property that is maintained in the Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Groups &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Groups module, the values in the dialog box are the group names as defined under Groups Management. Some groups have predefined names. Other groups define a Default group, and expect each installation to create additional groups.
- When a group filter is defined on a collected property, the values in the dialog box are the property values from the database.

Use the following procedure to set group filter values.

## Steps

1. Click the icon for a group filter. A dialog box of values appears.
2. Select one or more values to include in the report, and click Apply . The icon for the applied filter changes color to indicate that the filter is active.

The report redisplays, including only the data for the values you specified in the filter. For example:

- In a table report, the filter eliminates rows from the table.
- In a consolidated bar chart, the filter eliminates data from the metric calculations.
3. If multiple filters are available, optionally apply additional filters to further limit the displayed results.

4. To cancel a filter, click the filter icon and select Clear .

## Sorting on a table column

You can change the sort order of a table report. The column headers indicate the sort columns.

## About this task

There are two ways to change the sort order of a table report.

Temporary change

To sort the table by that column, click the column header.

Customize table columns

To set a more permanent sort and to specify more than one sort column, use the Customize Table Columns icon above the upper right corner of the table.

For a temporary sort change, use this procedure:

## Steps

1. Click a column header.

Based on the column you requested, the table redisplays in resorted order. The icon appears in the column header, indicating that the report is sorted by this column.

2. To reverse the sort order in that column, click the icon.
3. To sort by a different column, click the new column header. The report is resorted based on the new sort request.

## Show, hide, rearrange, and sort table columns

The Customize Table Columns icon lets you make custom changes to a table report while still in Browse mode.

## About this task

Show or hide columns

You can customize a report by hiding unwanted columns. Some reports define hidden columns. For example, many reports define columns for the business unit, customer, and location data enrichment fields, but hide the columns by default. If the installation defines values and data enrichment rules for one or all of those optional fields, those columns become meaningful.

Rearrange columns

You can move columns to appear in the preferred order.

Sort

You can override the default sort order that is defined for a table. You can specify one or multiple columns to use for sorting.

## Steps

1. Click Customize Table Columns , located in the menu that appears when you hover the cursor over the upper right corner of the table.

The Table Customization dialog box appears.

2. To change the order of columns in the table, drag column names up or down in the Displayed Columns list.
3. To show or hide columns in the table, choose one of the following:

| Option             | Description                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Display the column | The column is always displayed. |

<!-- image -->

| Option                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hide the column if it is empty | The column is hidden if its cells on the current report page are all empty. With this option, a sparsely populated column might appear on one page and be hidden on the next page. |
| Never display the column       | The column is always hidden.                                                                                                                                                       |

<!-- image -->

NOTE: These options might not always be available. The underlying report definition controls whether users can show or hide a column.

4. To sort the table (based on the values in one or more columns):
- a. Drag the columns to use for sorting to the Sorted Columns list. Drag a column into the sorted columns box, not the white space below it.
- b. For each sorted column, select Ascending or Descending .
- c. Drag to rearrange the sorted columns according to the sort order needed.
5. Click one of the following:

| Button                        | Description                                                       |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Apply                         | Apply changes on the report until it expires                      |
| Save and Apply                | Apply changes and save permanently (until you save other changes) |
| Revert to default report      | Cancel changes and revert to the report as defined in Edit mode   |
| Revert to saved customization | Return to values saved with Save and Apply                        |

## Reading baseline reports

Baseline reports show performance information about a single metric over a 24-hour period. The baseline helps you understand whether the current value of the metric is normal or a deviation that indicates a problem.

The following example baseline shows current and baseline values over time for a read throughput metric.

<!-- image -->

A baseline report contains the following information:

- Blue line-Shows the value of the metric over the last 24 hours.
- Gray line-Shows the average of the metric over the past 4 weeks, for the same day of the week and hours represented by the blue line.
- Shaded gray area-Shows the range of all values that are collected over the last 4 weeks for the same day of the week and hours represented by the blue line.

A baseline report needs more than 1 week of data before it can display the gray line representing the baseline average. When less than 1 week's values are available, only the blue line showing values for the last 24 hours appear on the report. A baseline is fully functional when 4 or more weeks of data are available.

Baselines are useful for interpreting performance metrics. The baseline lets you compare the current value of a metric to the average value over time. A deviation from the average stands out visually, drawing the attention of the user. You can also notice trends in the performance over time.

## Working with topology reports

Topology reports show relationships between components in the infrastructure. You can analyze from a topology map to detailed reports about the components.

## Topology reports

A topology report displays a graphical representation of the configuration items in the infrastructure and how they are linked together.

Topology reports depend on successful discovery of configuration items. Only discovered configuration items appear in the report.

A topology report consists of connected nodes. A node represents a configuration item.

- To analyze the home report or other available details for that node below the topology map, click a node icon.
- To expand the topology to show more detail, click the + symbol on a node icon.
- To contract an expanded node, click the -symbol in the lower-left corner.
- To display a tooltip, hover the cursor over any node or port symbol. Tooltips show details such as model names, utilization metrics, or port numbers.

## Finding and filtering nodes on topology reports

You can find and filter specific nodes on a topology report.

## Steps

1. On a storage system mixed report, hover the cursor over the Topology Map title. A text box and several buttons appear.
2. To find a node on the topology report, type the beginning of the node name in the text box and click Find a node (magnifying glass).
3. To restrict the map to show one node only, type the beginning of the node name in the text box and click Filter nodes (funnel).

## Metric Reports

A metric is data unit that you can regularly poll from a given instance out of a given object, device, service, or system. It is sometimes compared to a Key Performance Indicator (KPI). A metric value is always a numerical value and is stored in the time series databases.

## About this task

A property is used to describe a metric. You can better describe metrics by adding more properties, and even create your own data property names and definitions. Every metric is collected with their own set of properties. The model is unlimited and can be used to describe any object.

Dell SRM gathers many types of data from a storage infrastructure, depending on the installed options and SolutionPacks. In general, reports are populated by the following types of data:

- Capacity data provides the status of volume, sizing, and capacity utilization statistics, is considered as a measurement type of data collected, and based on a regular schedule.
- Performance data provides the instantaneous activity of an indicator, such as throughput rate, response time, IOPS, and CPU usage.
- Event data is composed of notifications that are received from a managed system. The event data differs in nature from a measurement that is collected at a regular scheduled. Examples of event data include: CPU utilization warning, high memory consumption, and disk running out of space.
- Metadata is more commonly known as properties. These refer to a set of associated data that is used to define the collected data (Capacity, Performance, and Event). It can refer to the system name, element name, version number, location, and many more.

To access metric reports:

## Steps

1. Log in to SRM Admin UI.
2. Browse to System Admin &gt; System Operations &gt; Data Model .

## Results

The report lists the unique metrics available in Database based on the below data model:

```
SRM-DATA-MODEL Table Expand on source Expand on devtype Expand on parttype Expand on datagrp Expand on name (metric Table which contains all the properties attached for this metric) no parttype Expand on datagrp Expand on name (metric Table which contains all the properties attached for this metric)
```

## About this task

Changes that you save while in Edit Mode is visible to all users, unless the changes are made in the My Reports node.

NOTE: Dell Technologies does not recommend to directly update the global reports.

Use any of the following methods to move a report into the My Reports node.

## Steps

1. Pin the report to a personal view.
2. Copy and paste a report from the main tree into the My Reports node. Do not use a link if you want to keep your copy separate from the copy in the main report tree.

To make your changes visible to all users, coordinate with an administrator to prevent multiple users from simultaneously editing the same template. Administrators might have you:

- Edit directly.
- Copy and paste.
- Extract the report as a template, add the template to a ReportPack, and hook the ReportPack to nodes in the main report tree. This method provides the best way to control the hooks and manage the tree hierarchy.

## Simultaneous edits by multiple users

If more than one user has write access to reports outside of My Reports , then it is possible for two users to edit report templates simultaneously, affecting each other's changes.

Templates or ReportPacks can become corrupted as a result. Only when the first user is finished editing, saves the changes, and logs out of the session can another user safely edit a report affecting the same template.

The following permission controls and change management procedures are recommended to avoid potential problems with multiple users affecting the same template:

1. Write access to global report templates should be assigned to a limited number of Administrator users. Assign this limited permission on Administration &gt; Users &amp; Security &gt; Users &amp; Roles &gt; Manage Roles &gt; New Role &gt; Template Access . Most users should have read-only access to templates.
2. Instruct users to edit reports only under My Reports . It is always safe because the changes are visible to only the current user and templates are not affected. No special permission is required.
3. Implement an internal change management process for users to submit requests to an Admin requesting changes to the global reports.
4. Always make a backup of the report tree before you begin making major changes to reports or the report tree outside of the My Reports node. You can create a report tree backup on Settings &gt; Custom Reports &gt; download a backup .

## Workflow for creating reports

When creating a report, decide first on the metrics to include, and then set the report type and the report details.

The workflow for creating reports is as follows:

1. Enter into the Edit mode.
2. Using the tools at the top of the report navigation tree, create the node for the new report in the report tree. There are two basic approaches:
- Copy an existing report to use as the basis for the new report.
- Create a report from scratch.

Either way, the remaining part of the workflow is the same.

3. Using the Filtering and Expansion tab, select the metrics to display in the report. Since the database may contain thousands of metrics, you must use filtering and expansion to narrow the metrics to display in a report.
4. Using the Report Configuration tab, set the type of report you want, such as a table or graph, and specify the period and aggregation to use in a report.
5. Depending on the report type that is selected, the Report Details: &lt;Report Type&gt; tab appears where you set the parameters for presenting information in the report.
6. Using the Formula tab, you can apply formulas to any node of the tree to perform advanced computations on any number of values.

## Workflow for creating a mixed report

Mixed reports let you combine several reports in a single report page or apply an overlay that displays events on top of a typical graph.

## About this task

The following types of mixed reports are supported.

| Mixed report         | Uses the report type from any child node but retains the selected period and aggregation from the selected node. This report is compatible with the mixed defaults report.   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mixed using defaults | Uses the default report settings from any child node. This report is compatible with the mixed report.                                                                       |
| Overlay              | Displays events that are superimposed on top of a graph report and a child table report listing a superset of events that are plotted in the overlays.                       |
| Tab report           | Shows a tabbed interface for navigating to reports.                                                                                                                          |

A mixed report uses the child nodes in the report tree as the source of the reports to include. To create nodes, use the report tree tools to add a report or copy and paste reports.

## Steps

1. Create a node in the report tree for the mixed report.
2. Under the new node, create child nodes for the reports in the mixed report.
3. In the report tree, select the parent node. The configuration tabs for that report appear in the report window.
4. On the Report Configuration tab, select the type of mixed report.

Select mixed , mixed using defaults , overlay , or tab .

5. On the Filtering &amp; Expansion tab, expand the Child Node Ordering section. The child nodes from the report tree are automatically listed there.
6. Edit the ordering of the nodes, if needed.
7. Click Save .
8. To see the shell of the mixed report, click Browse mode . For example, if you selected a tab report, you can see the tabs across the mixed report page.
9. Click Edit mode and complete the configuration for the mixed report and all of its child reports.

## Filtering and expansion tab

Filtering and expansion affect the report node properties. These properties are crucial to every node and report type because they determine what data is retrieved from the database.

The name of the report node, the filter that is used for metric selection, and some advanced settings that you can adjust are on the Filtering and Expansion tab.

## Filtering

The filter of a node is an expression that is used to select the metrics that make up the basic content of the report. Because the filter determines the report's dataset, it is a vital part of the overall report configuration. To set the filter correctly, you must know properties and its meaning. The collectors collect these properties. There are several ways to create a filter. If you know what properties and values you want to set, you can manually edit a filter. You can also use the Filter Wizard to help you define a filter.

## Expansion

The expansion setting is central to how the report tree works. It enables the quick generation of report trees, expanding its branches as it transforms individual nodes into multiple nodes. Expansion can automatically create and delete nodes as they appear or disappear in the database.

## Predicates

| Predicate                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| property='pattern'                    | Selects a variable based on a pattern. This pattern is a string that can contain SQL wildcards, such as the percent sign (%) and underscore (_).                                                                                                                                                                           |

| property                              | Selects only the variable of the specified property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| #<database type>- <database name>:id  | Selects the variable with the ID in the specified database. When using a cache group in the context of the APG-Property-Store, the database name is the cache group name. For example: #APG-DB:ALL For events, use the name of the corresponding resource in the APG.xml file with the FLOW-keyword. For example: RPE2:ALL |
| #<database type>- <database name>:ALL | Selects every variable in the specified database. For example: #APG-DB:ALL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Operators

| Operation   | Operator   |
|-------------|------------|
| AND         | &          |
| OR          | | (pipe)   |
| NOT         | !          |
| Is          | =          |
| Strictly is | ==         |

## Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when building and editing filter expressions:

- Enclose property values in single quotes. For example: devtype=='Router'
- Use the AND or OR operators to search for two or more property values. For example: devtype=='Router' &amp; parttype=='interface'
- Use parenthesis to enclose predicates and operators. For example: device=='Router\_A' &amp; (parttype=='Interface' | parttype=='Port')

## Complex node expansions

Complex expansions perform calculations within the context of an expansion.

With complex node expansions, you can:

- Separate properties, each having a list of values.
- Based on matching criteria group and remove nodes.
- Remove filters that are applied to parent nodes.

## Complex expansion types

You create complex expansions using the following expansion types:

- sql
- regex
- dual-regex
- split
- hide
- in-list

Based on a subpart of a property value, the expansion types create groups.

Expansions use pattern matching and transformations. The syntax for complex expansions is: property&lt; type=complex expansion type;param1=value1;param2=value2;... &gt; , where the expansion type is a string to identify which complex expansion to use. You cannot use the semicolon (;) or greater than (&gt;) characters in a parameter value.

## Combined Regex/Apg Pattern Match (type=sql)

Based on a pattern, this expansion uses two typical expressions and transformations to create groups. It is similar to the Dual Regex Pattern Match except that the values are matched in groups using a filter instead of a typical expression. Since this expansion is quicker than the others, use this one whenever possible.

This expansion uses these parameters:

| value-match        | The first typical expression that is matched against the property values.                                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| value-replace      | The replacement string that is applied to the previously matched values. The result of this replacement is the group name. |
| group-match        | A typical expression that is matched against the previously generated group names.                                         |
| group-replace- sql | A replacement string to create a pattern (with % and _ wildcards) to match property values to include in this group.       |

The expansion occurs in these phases:

- For each distinct property value, tries to match the property value with value-match. If the value matches, then replaces it using the replacement string value-replace. The resulting value creates a node in the tree.
- For each node created in the first phase, applies a transformation on its name using the typical expression group-match and replacement string group-replace-sql . This transformation creates a valid pattern that is applied to the created node as property='pattern' .

For example, if there are three devices in a network, the property device is expanded in three values: dev-w4n-montreal, router-w4n-montreal, server-w4n-toronto. To use the location to group devices, do the following:

- Create location groups from the device names with this expression: ^.*-w4n-(.*)$ â $1
- To match the groups montreal and toronto, use a matching device. A matching device is a device whose name ends with the group name, which is the city name in this example. For the montreal group, the matching filter is 'device=%montreal' .
- The expansion result is: device&lt;type=sql;value-match=^.*-w4n-(.*)$;value-replace=$1;groupmatch=^(.*)$;group-replace-sql=%-$1&gt;

## Regex Pattern Match (type=regex)

This expansion type is a simplified version of the two previous types. Most of the time, the values that are used to create group names belong to those groups, and only to those groups. This is what the Regex Pattern Match does, skipping the post matching phases of the Dual Regex Pattern Match and the Combined Regex/Pattern Match.

This expansion uses these parameters:

| value-match   | The first typical expression that is matched against the property values.                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| value-replace | The replacement string that is applied to the previously matched values. The result of this replacement is the group name. |

For example, if there are three devices in a network, that expands the property device into three values: dev-w4n-montreal, router-w4n-montreal, and server-w4n-toronto. To use the location to group devices, do the following:

The expansion occurs in these phases:

- For each distinct property value, tries to match the property value with value-match. If the value matches, then replaces it using the replacement string value-replace.
- The resulting value creates a node in the tree. The value that is transformed into the group name is automatically included in the group.
- The expansion result is: device&lt;type=regex;value-match=^.*-w4n-(.*)$;value-replace=$1&gt;

## Dual Regex Pattern Match (type=dual-regex)

This expansion uses these parameters:

| value-replace        | The replacement string that is applied to the previously matched values. The result of this replacement is the group name.   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| group-match          | A typical expression that is matched against the previously generated group names.                                           |
| group-replace- regex | A replacement string to create a typical expression from the group name, to match property values include in this group.     |

The expansion occurs in these phases:

- For each distinct property value, matches the property value with value-match . If the value matches, replaces it using the replacement string value-replace . The resulting value creates a node in the tree.
- For each node created, applies a transformation on its name using the typical expression group-match and replacement string group-replace-regex . This transformation creates a third typical expression.
- Rematches any property value with this typical expression. It works similar to a filter. The group node selects it if the value matches.

For example, if there are three devices in a network, the property device is expanded into three values: dev-w4n-montreal, router-w4n-montreal, and server-w4n-toronto. To use the location name to group these devices, do the following:

- Create location groups from the device names with this expression: ^.*-w4n-(.*)$ â $1
- To match the groups montreal and toronto, use a matching device. A matching device is a device whose name ends with the group name, which is the city name in this example. For the montreal group, the matching typical expression is ^.*-montreal$ .
- To match a device in a group, build the previous typical expression from the group name with this replacement: ^(.*)$ â .*-\\Q$1\\E
- The result is this expansion: device&lt;type=dual-regex;value-match=^.*-w4n-(.*)$;valuereplace=$1;group-match=^(.*)$;group-replace-regex=.*-\\Q$1\\E&gt;

## Split Property Expansion (type=split)

This expansion type creates reports using a relation between objects. A relation stores one or several object names, such as a device name, in another object's property, such as the remote system property.

This expansion uses these parameters:

| value-separator     | The character that is used to separate entries in the targeted property.                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| property- separator | The character that is used to separate properties when values contain multiple entries.                                                                                                         |
| properties          | The name of the properties. The split operation extracts the values of these properties. You can use multiple occurrences if more than one property must be identified in the generated filter. |
| level-up            | Parent nodes to be skipped in the construction of the node's filter.                                                                                                                            |
| name-override       | You can use a specific name for the created node.                                                                                                                                               |

In this example, the collected data includes the property peerifs that identifies peer interfaces. It contains a list of device-part pairs that is expressed similar to this: peerifs='device1,part1;device1,part2;device2,part1'

To create a node for each distinct device-part pair and associate a filter to each node that selects the correct data: device=='device1' &amp; part=='part1' . The result is: peerifs&lt;type=split;value-separator=~;;propertyseparator=,;properties=device;properties=part;level-up=5&gt;

You can use the tilde ( ~ ) character to escape the semi-column when it is the targeted character to split values or properties. If you want the filter to contain multiple parts, you can use the properties parameter several times. If not overridden by the name-override parameter, the name of the resulting node is the name of the matched value.

In this example, you can use the split expansion to void the filtering effect of parent nodes. This is useful when the filter is incompatible with the data you want to report on. For example, to report on interface utilization ( parttype='Interface' ) of devices with a Filesystem ( parttype='Filesystem' ), split on a property, create the filter using the same property, and use the level-up parameter to void the effect of the selection filter: device&lt;type=split;properties=device;level-up=1&gt; .

## Hide expansion (type=hide)

This expansion is used to prevent a property from being displayed when expanding on multiple properties.

For example, if you want to expand a node on device,deviceid because you have some hosts sharing the same device property. Deviceid is used to prevent hosts with the same device property from being merged into a single node, but the deviceid property is a long text string that you do not want to have displayed. By using the hide expansion ( device,deviceid&lt;type=hide&gt; ), the expansion works as it normally does only the deviceid is not displayed.

Example of hosts without using the hide expansion:

- example-host1, afekru23417
- example-host2, fdg98713424
- example-host3, dsfhng32442
- example-host3,dfsanl123412
- example-host4,134wf343244

Example of hosts using the hide expansion:

- example-host1
- example-host2
- example-host3
- example-host3
- example-host4

## In-list expansion (type=in-list)

This expansion checks if the value of a property is inside a list of another property value. Expansion occurs only if the value of a property in the parent is inside the property list value of a child.

This expansion uses these parameters:

| Values separator   | The value separator.                                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List property      | Property containing the list.                                     |
| Name override      | Can be used to override the generated node names.                 |
| Level up           | Tells how many nodes should be skipped in the filter computation. |

## Add or remove group filters

A group filter appears in the header of a report. It provides a convenient way for users to filter a report on a predefined property or set of properties.

## About this task

A group filter presents values for one or more properties in a checkbox format. Users can select multiple property values under a property, and the report is filtered to show data for the selected values. Any property that appears in the report can be used in a group filter, including the data enrichment properties.

Use this procedure to add or delete a group filter. For group filter syntax information, see Group Filter in the Help topic named Filtering and expansion parameters .

## Steps

1. In Edit mode, click the Filtering &amp; Expansion tab.
2. Expand the Group filter section.
3. To add a filter:
- a. Click Add Property .
- b. Click Simple at the top of the dialog box.
- c. Select the property that you want to create a filter for.

To be meaningful, the property must be used in the report. Use the Report Details tab to research the property names that are used in the report.

- d. To combine properties in the same filter, select multiple properties and then click Selected properties must be grouped at the lower-right of the dialog box.
- e. Click OK .

- f. Click Switch to list and edit the expression if needed.
4. To remove a filter:
- a. Click Switch to input field .
- b. Remove a property from the expression.
5. Click Save .

## Filtering and expansion parameters

You define the scope of data to include in a report on the Filtering &amp; Expansion tab. You define the basic properties of a report, such as its name, ID, icon, and when and how to display the report in the tree.

## Name

The name of the report that you are creating. If you use expansion, the report name represents the expansion evaluation.

## Unique identifier

You can link between reports by using the identifier. When you paste a report as a link, you can use the unique identifier if it exists. A unique identifier consists of letters, numbers, and the characters period (.) comma (,) dash (-), underscore (\_), or spaces. You can also use report identifiers to define report restrictions and to control branches to be skipped by the frontend search engine.

This option is hidden by default. To access this option, click the anchor icon to the right of the Name field.

## Filter

A filter is an expression that limits the number of metrics that are displayed on a report. A filter is vital to configuring a report because it determines the dataset of the report. You can manually create a filter when you know which properties and values to include in a filter, or you can use the Filter Wizard to help you define the filter.

## Use the filter of this node for

Use this field when using both expansion and a filter.

| expansion only          | Applies the filter while expanding the node using expansion. Any nodes that do not match the filter are not created. Selected variables are not affected by the filter. The filter is used to craft the expansion, but the filter is not used when you analyze. This is useful when you are doing a filter on a property which is not shared by every raw data (like devdesc).   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| selection only          | Applies the filter after node expansion. The system performs expansion without taking the filter into account, and passes each resulting node through the filter. The system expands on everything and then applies the filter for underlying data. This is useful when you have inventory reports, where some expansions can have zero children.                                |
| expansion and selection | Combines both expansion and selection. The filter of the node is used for node generation and each resulting node for the variables it selects. The system expands on matching raw data. The filter is kept when drilling down.                                                                                                                                                  |

## Display Policy

Use this field to simplify the presentation of the report tree by hiding certain report nodes and showing only relevant report nodes.

| Always show the node            | Always shows the node in the report tree. This is the default behavior.                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hide if no variable is selected | Hides the node if its filter does not select any metric.                                                                                 |
| Hide if the node is a leaf      | Hides the node if it does not have any children. This is particularly useful with expanded nodes, as they may expand into an empty list. |

| Hide if no variable is selected or if the node is a leaf   | This is a combination of the Hide if no variable is selected and Hide if the node is a leaf policies.                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hide in Browse mode but use for report computation         | This policy is useful when you define a node to build reports above it in the tree, but not as a report itself. When you chain formulas, use this policy. |
| Always hide this node                                      | Never shows the node in the report tree. This can temporarily disable a report and any formulas applied to this node.                                     |
| Hide except when it's the target of a link                 | Hides the node except when it is the target of a link.                                                                                                    |
| Show this node only in the tree and not in the report      | Forbids drilling down to this node from a parent report.                                                                                                  |

## Expand on every

This setting is central to how the report tree works. Expansion dynamically creates sub nodes. Sub nodes add levels to a report so you can analyze. When a node is set to expand, the node transforms itself from a single node to as many nodes as there are matches of the specified property name in the dataset.

By using expansion, you can define a report that automatically creates and deletes nodes that are based on the properties found in the dataset. For example, as devices are added to the network, they are automatically added to the report when their properties match the expansion criteria.

## Group filter

This setting creates property-specific filters in Browse mode. The result is a filter icon with the property name at the top of the report, and an associated dialog box that lists values in a checkbox format. This feature works with any property, including the property tagging filter (PTF) groups that are managed in the Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Groups &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Groups interface.

Add Property adds a property to the group filter expression.

| Simple   | Adds a simple filter for a database property, including flat groups managed in Administration > CONFIG > Groups & Tags > Manage Groups . To add a simple filter: 1. Click Add Property > Simple . 2. Select the property. Use the Report Details:Table tab to research properties that appear in the table. 3. To combine multiple properties into the same filter, select the properties and then click Properties must be grouped .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Complex  | Adds a filter with a dialog box of choices that matches the hierarchy of group names in a hierarchical group type managed in Administration > CONFIG > Groups & Tags > Manage Groups . For example, in Groups Management, Device Grouping is a hierarchical group that expands on the nodegrp property. To add a filter for a hierarchical group type: 1. Click Add Property > Complex . 2. Choose Expand on groupping ui formatted data enrichment properties . 3. Follow the steps in the expansion wizard. 4. To match the group management interface, use the /character as the hierarchical (level) separator and the | character as the expansion-separator. 5. Click OK . Here is the complex expansion for the nodegrp property. It creates a hierarchical dialog box of filter values that matches the hierarchy of device group names that are defined in Groups Management. |

All selected properties are combined into a single group filter expression. After adding properties, click Switch to List to see the entire group filter specification. You can make adjustments to the syntax. The syntax for multiple filters is described in the table:

## Use filter on unmatched variables

Use this field to create nodes using variables that are not selected by the sibling nodes.

| No                                   | The node acts as an Others or Unmatched node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| For the edit node filter             | Selects all the variables that are not selected by the sibling nodes with reference to the Edit mode filters. For example, if a few sibling nodes select the same IP address, the Other node selects all the other IP addresses. If there is no expansion, there is no distinction between the Edit and Browse node filters. Use this setting in most cases. If there is an expansion, this setting returns the unmatched results of the sibling filters as they appear in Edit mode. This differs from how the resulting node filters are expressed in Browse mode, and provides different results. |
| For the resulting browse node filter | Use this setting when using the Top N for the events property to select a reduced set of results in the expansion, or when doing complex expansions that result in a partial list of results. In both cases, the unmatched results are evaluated against the filters of the expanded nodes in Browse mode, resulting in all variables that are not chosen by any expanded nodes. In both cases, the results are subject to any parent node filters. You can use filters on these other variables that the node with the unmatched option selects.                                                    |

## Report Display Preference

You can use a stored report instead of creating a report that takes a considerable amount of time to generate.

| Use Real Time Values   | The report is generated on-the-fly.                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prefer Stored Report   | When you click the report node, the most recent and available stored report appears. Otherwise, the report is generated on-the-fly.                              |
| Use Only Stored Report | When you click a report node, the most recent and available stored report appears. Otherwise, a notice appears, indicating the system cannot display the report. |

## Node Icon

You can use a node icon for the following report areas:

- As a small icon in the tree alongside the node name
- As a medium icon on the report alongside the element titles
- As a large icon in icon reports

If you want to choose an icon automatically, use the default icon.

## Top N for events

You can limit the number of results that are returned, which can significantly speed up the time it takes to generate reports. This setting is only applicable for events, and is only visible if it was declared in at least one of the event mapping files being used.

## Child Node Ordering

You can arrange child nodes manually by dragging and dropping them in Ordered by Position , or you can arrange them alphabetically in Ordered by Name . You only can see this field if child nodes exist.

## Defining report types

A report type determines the layout of a report. You select the report type on the Report Configuration in Edit Mode tab. You can also select the report type in Display Mode through settings icon in each report.

## Steps

1. In Display Mode , indicate how you want multiple reports to appear on the report page.

The default behavior displays one report after another report.

2. In Report Type , click the layout to use for the report.

The report types are divided into the following categories:

- Tables
- Graphs
- Aggregated
- TopN
- Misc
- Mixed

Within a report category, all the report details are the same. This means that you can change the Report Type to another one in the same category and the report settings remain applicable. After you save the settings, the report details are saved from session to session, even if you switch to another report type.

3. In Report Rendering , select the type of rendering to apply to the report.
4. In Default Duration , specify the time range to display on the report.
5. In Sampling Period , indicate the time interval to use to collect data from the database.
6. In Sampling Type , specify the aggregation to use.
7. Click Propagate time selection on drill-down to apply the report's time periods to its sub-reports.
8. In Report Description , type the information to display at the top of the report. You can use XHTML in &lt;div&gt; tags in the description.
9. In Displayed Properties , click Add property for each property that you want to include in the report header. You can select one from a list of default properties or type a custom property.

Report Configuration tab Report configuration parameters

## Report configuration parameters

You set the type, the time period, the rendering, the aggregation, and the description of a report on the Report Configuration tab. You can also use the advanced settings of Report Configuration tab to define the time zone and indicate whether to use dynamic maintenance periods.

## Display Mode

Indicate how to place multiple reports on the report page for viewing. The default behavior displays one report after another report. You can also manually rearrange reports on a page.

## Report Type

Select which report type to use for displaying metrics on this node.

## Report Rendering

Select the rendering to apply on the report, including any displayed sub-report.

Dynamic rendering is available on standard charts and provides better zooming and analyzing tools than the static one. However, it can have a performance impact if enabled on many reports simultaneously.

## Default Duration

Select the time range to display on the report. Sometimes, this time range is not taken into account. For example, if the report is using a formula where the duration is explicitly selected, this default value is bypassed. You can exclude time periods from the report by clicking the calendar icon.

## Sampling Period

The aggregate interval to use to gather data from the database. You can also configure the report to use aligned data for one of the aggregates.

## Sampling Type

The aggregation to use to gather data from the database. This is not applicable to some report types, such as pie charts and horizontal bars.

## Propagate time selection on drill-down

Enable the temporal settings of the current report to use for all child reports when drilling down to them from the report in the page area. The settings are:

- Default Duration
- Sampling Period
- Sampling Time

## Report Description

This description displays at the top of a report. You can use XHTML in &lt;div&gt; tags in the description.

## Displayed Properties

These properties display at the top of the report, which includes the contact name and location. The default name of the property can appear in its title, which displays in the gray text box.

Always use this setting when the report is for a single device because only one value appears for each added property.

## Time Zone

Specify the time zone for a report generated on the current node. Inherit means that the time zone is inherited from the parent node. If there is no parent, the report uses the time zone from the profile of the current user.

The first field indicates whether the report uses universal time, the default, or whether the time period is aligned. Universal time indicates that the time period corresponds to the report's time zone in the adjacent list, and the data shown in the report is relative to its time zone. For example, selecting the last hour of data displays data from the current time, which is 10:00 America/Montreal time, and appears along the x-axis, back to 9:00 America/Montreal time. If you are monitoring a device in Montreal, you can see its activity data between 9:00 to 10:00. If you are also monitoring devices in Paris at this time, the activity data is between 3:00 and 4:00 AM Europe/Paris.

The other effect of universal time is that daily and weekly aggregates are delineated on UTC time. For example, the daily aggregation period for America/Montreal is from 18:00 - 19:00 whereas the Montreal time zone offset is UTC - 5 hours.

## Align data on UTC using tz property with the following reference

This setting time shifts the data from different time zones to align them. The setting aligns data in order for the time zone to be independent in the report. Aligned data displays using aligned aggregates.

The effects of aligned time zone aggregates are:

- Data from different time zones is time-shifted to a universal day where data is expressed according to the local time zone where the data was recorded. For example, data at 9:00 locally is aligned with data at 9:00 at a remote time zone. Data can then be compared at each time zone in relation to how users experience it during a typical day or week. Without using aligned aggregates, data from different time zones is expressed in relation to the local time zone of the report.
- For aligned daily and weekly aggregates, days and weeks are delineated according to 24 hour 7 day periods where time zones are aligned. Without using aligned aggregates, days and weeks are delineated according to UTC.

When you use aligned data, the second time zone list sets the reference. This is important when choosing data from the last day. If the data is aligned and America/Montreal is the reference point, and it is 13:00 in Montreal and you display the last day of information, the data returned is from 13:00 today to 13:00 yesterday. If you choose Europe/Paris as the reference, and it is

19:00 in Paris, the last day extends the report from 19:00 on the current day to 19:00 yesterday and there will not be information in the report for the last 6 hours in Montreal because it has not occurred yet in the day where the time zones are aligned.

Reference is important if time zones occur on different days. The day the report covers is determined by the reference time zone.

For this functionality to be available, it must be configured in the backend and the frontend. Whether there are daily and weekly aligned aggregates is determined in the backend setup. For aligned aggregates of one hour or less, the frontend computes them on the fly on a best effort basis if aligned time zones are enabled. Some aggregates are not generated: the local time of the aggregate must be a number of whole hours offset from UTC for the one hour aligned aggregate to be computed. Locations with an additional half-hour offset such as Asia/Kolkata (UTC +5:30), are not computed.

You are not explicitly informed whether time zone aligned aggregates are available, but in most cases, if Align data on UTC using tz property with the following reference is available in the first time zone list, aligned time zone aggregates are available for each sampling period.

These constraints apply to aligned data:

- Maintenance periods configured in the interface appear in graphs but not used for computations or in tables. If you configure a maintenance period from 8 to 9, this period is highlighted in the graph, and pertains to 8 to 9 in all time zones, as the data is aligned.
- Do not use the Outage Editor with aligned data as the results are inaccurate.
- Do not plot events on the same graphs as aligned data with an Overlay, as the results are inaccurate. Events cannot be aligned across time zones as time series data can.

## Dynamic Maintenance Periods

Set the maintenance period to use for this node according to the one set in the Outage Manager. Maintenance periods are incompatible with aligned time zones.

## Outages type

Set the type to the category set in the Outage Manager.

## Outages property

Set the value to the property you would like to use for matching. If the value of the property matches one of the objects in the Outage Manager, that outage is applied.

## Enable Audit Logging

If you want to enable the audit logging for the My Reports and it's derived branches, then tick the Enable Audit Logging check box. This feature is disabled for non-custom reports as logging is always enabled for non-custom report. If any of the report has this option enabled, then all the following child reports inherit the property and cannot be overridden.

| List               | Lists the child node names of a parent. You can examine to more detailed reports. This is the default report type.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Standard table     | Displays one row per child node. You select the columns, such as availability. You then expand the table node with child nodes in the report tree, which automatically generates the data in the rows of the report. For example, if a child node expands on host, each row contains data about individual hosts in the network. |
| Metric-based table | Displays the metrics of the child nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Interactive table  | Controls the display of adjacent reports. You can browse from one report to another while maintaining a list of reports on the same page. The reports that display next to the interactive table are the child nodes of the interactive table. You can place these tables in mixed reports.                                      |
| Item               | Displays a limited amount of data as an icon. You can define up to 5 data values (columns) and place them in desired locations within the icon. There can be only one sub node (that is, only one row when converted to a standard table).                                                                                       |

For example, if you are reporting on a month or year, selecting a day or week aggregate instead of real-time dramatically increases the report generation speed. It is important because with such long ranges, such detail is not typically required. The period selection option is related to the sampling period. It is because the application can automatically select a higher aggregate than the one selected when it really fits the report time-range. It provides better performance and scales no matter the report time range. When you unable to change the specified aggregate, always choose this option. However, it can trigger a high report generation time if the report time range is too wide. NOTE: When you select a small sampling period, such as real-time, allow for the selection of higher periods for better performance. |
| Sampling Type                          | Selects one of the available aggregated values that are stored in the database. You can choose average, min, max, sum, the last value, count, the number of received values, or last timestamp, and the timestamp of the last received value, on the previously selected aggregate period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Column Time Range(s)                   | Selects whether to use the global report time range for the values of this column, or a fixed one. A fixed range is relative to the end time of the report. It may also be divided into time slices, creating several columns in Browse mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Allow filtering on the value?     | Triggers the use of a JEXL Boolean expression in which the value must match to display. The $v variable represents the numeric value. In the following examples, rows are only shown when: â empty(v) : the value is empty â (v >= 0.00 or v < 0.00) and not empty(v) : the value is (greater or equal to 0.00 or less than 0.00) and not empty â v > 10.00 or v < 5.00 : the value is greater than 10.00 or less than 5.00 â v != 0.00 and not empty (v) : the value is not equal to 0.00 and not empty â v == 0.00 && not empty(v) : the value is equal to 0.00 and not empty |

| Scaling Mode                | If the unit of the values does not correspond to what you want to display, this field provides a way to convert the values. â none does not convert values. â multiply multiplies all values by the decimal value that you supply in the by field that appears when you make this selection. â divide divides all values by the decimal value that you supply in the by field that appears when you make this selection. â by unit converts the existing unit values into new unit values without requiring you to provide the formula. For example, using selections from the drop-down lists that appear, you can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, or Packets per second into KPkts per second. Explore the drop-down lists to see all the supported conversions. |

## Item reports (hero dashboards)

An item report is a type of table report. Each row is displayed as a self-contained item, with the column information mapped to a position in the item.

A series of item reports can create an easy-to-read dashboard, sometimes called a hero dashboard, that makes important information easily visible.

Here are example item reports on a hero dashboard:

## Item report parameters

You define information to include in an item report and design the look of the report on the Report Details: Item tab.

An item report is a type of table report. To specify the information to include in the report, you define columns, the same as for other types of table reports. A column is defined based on an Attribute, a Property, a Value, an Aggregate of other columns, or a Combined cell of other columns. For more information about adding and configuring columns, see Table report parameters.

The following parameters control the look of the item report, after you have defined the columns.

| Item Alignment   | Defines whether the item report (all items in the report) is aligned to the left margin, centered, or right margin of the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Design Map       | Defines which columns to include in the item report, and where to position each column. Drag a column from the unpositioned section to the desired location in the design map. Sections in the design map can hold multiple columns. Click the Tools icon that is associated with a column to access the column formatting parameters. |

## Graph reports

You can add more graphing information or precision to any graph report, including standard, aggregated, and baseline graph reports.

Graph reports plot variables along the X (time) and Y (value) axes. Depending on the graph type, metrics can come from the current node or from the children nodes. You can use time series graphs that display multiple metrics that are related to a data selection or events that show only one series of values per event series.

There are value and baseline graphs that are available on every node of the tree, although baseline graphs require more than one week of data. Value graphs are generated using the properties of a selected node and its filter.

Graph reports can also have two y-axes, with two different sets of metrics plotted against them.

| Composite   | Displays four supplementary mini-graphs at the bottom showing the evolution of the metric over four different time periods. The default time periods are: the last year, the last six months, the last month, and the last day. The time periods are configurable by your system administrator. |

## Graph report parameters

You define the contextual settings of graph reports on the Report Details: Graph tab. This includes standard and aggregated graph reports, and the baseline report.

## Main Y-Axis Boundaries

You can set up y-axis fixed bounds for the report to automatically focus on a relevant data range. This is useful when the acceptable values of the range are already known, such as availability data.

## Main Y-Axis Scaling Mode

You can scale the values on the y-axis. If the values are too high or too low to be meaningful, you can multiply or divide by a factor that produces a meaningful number. You can also choose by-unit and select the required conversion using the offered choices. The Binary scale, such as KiB and MiB, uses 1024 as the scaling factor, and is typically used for computer memory. The Decimal scale, such as KB and MB, uses 1000, and is typically used in storage. Classic was created for the old interpretation of the multipliers where K = 1024.

## Thresholds Definition

Critical and major thresholds appear in the graph only if you give them values. You can add as many thresholds as necessary, giving each a different value and color. If there is a second y-axis in the graph, the thresholds you set are applicable only to the main y-axis.

Thresholds have a different meaning for Time Ratio Bar Graphs. For these graphs, thresholds define the intervals for computing the time ratios and the colors of the bars. For example, two thresholds actually define three intervals. The first interval gathers all values below or equal to the lowest threshold. The second interval retrieves all the values above the first and below or equal to the second. The last interval gathers all the values above the second threshold. The unit marked next to the input box tells you how to enter the threshold definitions.

## Map reports

A map report is a standard table report where each child node displays as a point in a geographical map. You can edit the location and the name of the location as well as the size, color, and shape of marker displayed on the map.

In Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the map report from the miscellaneous section.

You can edit the following attributes on a map report:

- Location locates an element on the map.
- Name provides a name to a location, such as device name, region, and sitename.
- Size sets the size of the marker. The size of the marker is based on a given metric value, such as the number of devices at the site.
- Color sets the color of the marker. The color relies on the threshold definition where green represents no thresholds, yellow represents a major threshold, and red represents a critical threshold.
- Marker sets the shape of the marker, such as circle, square, triangle, inverted triangle, pentagon, and sector.

## Overriding the location

You can override the location in the selected data if the location is not correctly displayed on the map. For example, "Rome Office" is displayed on the map in Rome, Ohio instead of in Italy. To fix this, you can override the location and set it to "Roma, Italia." The following example overrides the location of device1 with latitude and longitude values: device1=42.2251051 -71.5315623

## Steps

1. Click the Report Details: Map tab.
2. Click the Location tab.
3. Click Advanced Properties .
4. In Location overrides , type the new location information.

The locations entered here have precedence over the ones that are found in the selected data. The correct format is: name=location, one pair per line.

5. Click Save .

## Setting the icon size for child nodes

Icon size is calculated as a ratio between the node's value and the minimum and maximum value of the other nodes. The default minimum and maximum values can be changed if the theoretical min and max are known, such as for a percentage.

## Steps

1. Click the Report Details: Map tab.
2. Click the Marker tab.
3. Type the minimum and maximum values for marker size.
4. Click Save .

## Example

Suppose Device 1 has a CurrentUtilization of 10 percent while Device 2 has a CurrentUtilization of 13 percent. If you leave the min and max boxes empty, the maximum value is 13 and the minimum value is 10. Therefore, Device 2 has an icon that is the maximum size (64x64 pixels) and Device 1 has the smallest icon possible (16x16 pixels). However, as these are a percentage, you can set the maximum to 100 and the minimum to 0 to ensure that the icons for Device 1 and Device 2 are almost the same size.

## Map report parameters

The settings on the Report Details: Map tab combine table report settings and map-specific settings to create a map report.

You set map attributes using the tabs in the Map Item Configuration section. You define the information to appear on the map in the Displayed Information section. This information uses the same column attributes, properties, and values as the table

report. Any changes that are made to the columns in the Displayed Information section are replicated in the columns in the Table Report: Details tab and conversely.

## Map Item Configuration tabs

| Name     | Defines the column that contains the icon's name. When you hover over an icon, this name is displayed in a tooltip. This information is also used as the title when opening a pop-up by clicking an icon. The selected column can be a property column or an attribute column. You can select from that already configured or create a property or attribute column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Marker   | Defines the icon or area marker for each point. Current choices for icons are: circle, square, triangle, inverted triangle, and pentagon. â Size - Defines the column that determines the size of the icon for each child node. This column can be of any type and must contain a numeric value. You can use attribute, properties, or values that exist, or you can create a new one. The size is calculated as a ratio between the node's value and the minimum and maximum value of the other nodes. These minimum and maximum values can be overwritten if the theoretical min and max are known, such as for a percentage. To override them, type values in the Minimum and Maximum boxes. For example: Assume that you are mapping two devices for which the CurrentUtilization metric determines the size. Device-1 has a CurrentUtilization of 10 percent, while Device-2 has a CurrentUtilization of 13 percent. If the min and max boxes are empty, the maximum value is 13 and the minimum value is 10. Therefore, Device-2 has an icon with the maximum size (64x64 pixels) while Device-1 has the smallest icon possible (16x16 pixels). However, since these values can use a percentage, set the maximum to 100 and the minimum to 0 to ensure the icons for Device-1 and Device-2 are almost the same size, showing a realistic representation. â Color - Defines the column that determines the color of the icon for each child node. It is a value column and |

## Heat map reports

A heat map report displays metrics in colors in a two-dimensional grid. You group metrics together and set the thresholds to color code the range of values for hot and cold areas. For example, red can indicate a severe problem and a lighter shade of red can indicate a warning.

You can group any combination of metric properties to define the axes of the grid. You can aggregate these metrics over time for one or both axes. The produced heat map report displays the aggregated values according to the specified time unit, which can be an hour, day, week, month, or year.

In Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the heat map report from the aggregated section.

## Heat Map report parameters

You set how you want information presented in a heat map on the Report Details: Heat Map tab.

## Axes Configuration

Select one of the following expansion types for each axis.

- Select use report expansion to expand the axis using the parameters that are specified for the report on the Report Configuration tab. The ordering on the axis is defined by the Order field.
- Select use time expansion to build a heat map that displays the evolution of variables based on a unit of time (for example, a day, a week, and a month). If you select this value, the Sampling Period and Over fields appear. For example, you can expand an axis to show a Sampling Period of every day over some time period, such as a week or a year.

If the report duration is 1 year and the x-axis time range is for each 1 day over 1 week, each heatmap value is an aggregate (such as an average, minimum, or maximum) of all values of each time period included in the report duration.

## Scaling Mode

If the unit of the values does not correspond to what you want to display, this field provides a way to convert the values. Select one of the following:

- none does not convert values.
- multiply multiplies all values by the decimal value you supply in the by field that appears when you make this selection.
- divide divides all values by the decimal value you supply in the by field that appears when you make this selection.
- by unit converts the existing unit values into new unit values without requiring you to provide the formula. For example, using selections from the drop-down lists that appear, you can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, or Packets per second into KPkts per second (or MPkts, GPkts, or TPkts per second). Explore the drop-down lists to see all the supported conversions.

## Order

Defines how to order rows and columns in the heat map when the axes configurations are use report expansion . See the tooltip next to the field for explanations of each option.

## Show Grid

When selected, draws a border around the heat map cells.

## Use Gradient Color

When selected, inserts gradient colors on the heat map cells that are between the closest thresholds.

## Thresholds Definition

Thresholds do not appear in the report unless you give them values. You can add as many thresholds as necessary, giving each a different value and color. If there is a second y-axis in the graph, the thresholds you set here are applicable only to the main y-axis.

## Properties in Legend

These properties display in the graph's legend to identify the variables. To select the properties to appear in the legend, click Edit Properties . To reorder their appearance in the legend, hover the cursor over a row and drag it to the required position.

## Tooltip Information

Choose properties to add to the tooltips that appear when a user hovers the cursor over a location in the report. The additional information is added in the form of a description followed by the property values. For example:

<!-- image -->

To select properties, click Add Property .

- Type the database property name, such as device , or click the property selector icon for help.
- Choose the description to appear on the first line.
- default uses the system-provided description for the property. For example, Device name is supplied for the device property.
- none does not use a description.
- custom lets you supply a phrase.

## Treemap reports

A treemap report displays metrics in a hierarchy using size and color. Based on the tree hierarchy, each branch is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles to represent the metric aggregation from each child node.

In Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the treemap report from the aggregated section.

## Treemap report parameters

You define how to present information on a treemap report on the Report Details: Treemap tab.

## Number of Levels

Sets the depth of the report. You can select up to three levels. For example, to create a global report showing the total capacity of arrays, pools, and LUNs, set this level to three. To report on the total capacity for arrays and pools only, set this level to two.

## Size

These settings determine the area size of the cells for the lower nodes.

You can choose inherited from report, average, min, max, sum, last value, count, or last timestamp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Recover...      | Determines if all values are retrieved over the report time range, or only the last value. If all values are retrieved, then they are aggregated to a single value using the selected function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Time Threshold  | The time interval relative to the report time value, which acts like a tolerance interval for data retrieval. If you select real-time, the threshold is in seconds. If you select an aggregate sampling type, the time threshold is a number of periods. NOTE: If you set zero for a time threshold while recovering only the last value using a real-time sampling period, an empty table cell may result. Always set a meaningful threshold according to the sampling period. |
| Scaling Mode    | If the unit of the values does not correspond to what you want to display, select multiply or divide from this list. In the corresponding field, you can then type the factor to apply, which allows you to change from bytes to kilobytes, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This filter applies to each line of the table, which represents each child node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Sampling Type            | Selects one of the available aggregated values that are stored in the database. You can choose average, min, max, sum, the last value, count, the number of received values, or last timestamp, and the timestamp of the last received value, on the previously selected aggregate period.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Recover...               | Determines if all values are retrieved over the report time range, or only the last value. If all values are retrieved, then they are aggregated into a single value using the selected function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Time Threshold           | The time interval relative to the report time value, which acts like a tolerance interval for data retrieval. If you select real-time, the threshold is in seconds. If you select an aggregate sampling type, the time threshold is a number of periods. NOTE: If you set zero for a time threshold while recovering only the last value using a real-time sampling period, an empty table cell may result. Always set a meaningful threshold according to the sampling period. |
| Scaling Mode             | If the unit of the values does not correspond to what you want to display, select multiply or divide from this list. In the corresponding field, you can then type the factor to apply, which allows you to change from bytes to kilobytes, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Critical Level           | The value for the critical threshold level. You can leave it empty to deactivate this level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Major Level              | The value for the major threshold level. You can leave it empty to deactivate this level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Gauges

A gauge shows one value in a meter. The report definition defines the value being measured, the upper and lower bounds of the gauge, and optional thresholds for identifying severity.

In the following gauge, the boundaries are defined as -1 and 1. The current measurement is 0.

<!-- image -->

Threshold that is defined on the measured value can change the color of the gauge. For example, a green gauge indicates that the current value falls within the defined range for Normal, whereas a red gauge indicates a Critical value, according to the defined thresholds.

## Gauge report parameters

The Report Details: Gauge tab defines the metric to measure, its lower and upper bounds, and threshold ranges.

## Value

This section defines the metric value that the gauge is reporting.

Adjusting this option can significantly reduce report generation time. For example, if you are reporting on a month or year, selecting a day or week aggregate instead of real-time dramatically increases the report generation speed. It is important because with such long ranges, such detail is not typically required. The period selection option is related to the sampling period. It is because the application can automatically select a higher aggregate than the one selected when it really fits the report time-range. It provides better performance and scales no matter the report time range. When you are unable to change the specified aggregate, always choose this option. However, it can trigger a high report generation time if the report time range is too wide.

## Editing external reports

An external report is a web page that is displayed in the report pane.

## About this task

The Report Details: External tab contains the URL of the page to display.

Other report definition tabs, such as Filtering &amp; Expansion and Report Configuration define the report.

## Steps

1. Click the Report Details: External tab.
2. Edit the URL in the External report address field.
3. Edit other tabs if needed.
4. Click Save .

## External report address

The external report address field on the Report Details: External tab contains the URL of the page to display in the report.

With an external report, you can access and display data from external software and display the retrieved data in the report pane. The request for data is included in the URL.

The URL can include the following parameters.

## Table 22. URL parameters

| Parameter                                                                     | Example                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ${ property } where: property is an APG property name from the APG databases. | To filter results from an external database by device, use ${device} in the URL.                                                                            |
| @{ attribute } where: attribute is an attribute of the report nodes.          | If the Filtering & Expansion tab defines device filters, you might want to display the filter values in the report. To do so, use @{nodeFilter} in the URL. |

## Example URLs

To query Bing:

```
http://www.bing.com/search?q=${parttype}
```

To query an external defect database and list entries that are associated with a specific device:

```
http://jira.yourcompany.com:8443/issues/?jql=project%3DEMP AND text~"${device}"
```

To open the vSphere client software:

https://${device}/vsphere-client/?csp

## @{ attribute } values

Use @{ attribute } to display an attribute of the report node in the report. These attribute parameters represent the same parameters that you can select for an attribute column in a table report.

NOTE: These attributes are the same attributes that you can select in a table report for an attribute column.

## Topology reports

A topology report displays a graphical representation of the devices within a network and how they are linked together.

You can build and display transactions graphically in a topology report. You can use this report to represent a specific section of a network and to display various data between the different elements within a section. It enables you to represent different pieces of equipment and services and the various metrics and key performance indicators linking them together.

In Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the topology report from the miscellaneous section.

## Report elements

Nodes and edges define a topology report. The nodes represent the different elements of a transaction or the various elements of a topology representing a network section. The edges define the relationships between the nodes. A node can have either none, one, or multiple edges linking to other nodes (n-to-n relationship). The edges are capped with an arrow, pointing from one node to another to represent the flow.

All elements in the report are plotted on a surface that is called a canvas. The canvas has a rectangular shape and consists of tiles that are called cells. A node can only be one cell and a cell can only have one node.

## Layers

Layers and map types are collections of nodes and connections between nodes that present a specific view, such as a physical connectivity view or a logical connectivity view. The difference is that you can select multiple layers to be simultaneously displayed for a report, but you can display only one map type for a report at any time.

Display layers through the Layers panel and display a map type with the Map Type drop-down list. This list is only visible in topology maps that have been defined to use layers.

## Overlays

An overlay is a defined subset of visual indicators, such as bullets, images, spark lines, and color, that provides additional information about nodes and connections in a network. For example, overlays might be defined to inform users about availability, performance, and health. A user can manually display or hide an overlay by selecting or clearing it in the Layers and Overlays menu on the topology map.

## Hop Count

The hop count is the number of devices that data must pass through from a source to a destination. Topology maps can be defined to display the Increase Hop Count , Decrease Hop Count , and Reset Hop Count icons that enable the number of elements being displayed to increase or decrease according to the number hops selected. The hop icons are not displayed in topology maps that have not been defined to support the feature.

## Topology report parameters

You define the source and layout of the report on the Report Details: Topology tab. An administrator must configure topology reports before you can set the source and layout for a report.

## Mode

The mode of the topology report determines the source of the report. It is fully customizable.

| Simple   | Displays the instances of classes from the selected topology that meet the report filter. For example, if you select Router as the class, and the instances in the class are R1, R2, and R3 and the report filter is devtype=="Router" and device=="R1"; only the R1 router appears in the report.   |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Advanced | Use the Filter setting to restrict nodes to the report filters. It does not apply to the root nodes because they are the starting point of the graph. The root nodes are always restricted to the report filter.                                                                                     |

|                  | For example, if you use this configuration and the report filter is devtype=='Switch', and you do not click the Filter checkbox, the hosts appear in the report, although they do not meet the report filter. All switches, which are determined by the report filter and linked to the hosts in the topology, appear in the report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Drilldown        | Renders a report based on the sub-reports of the current report. If the current report has three sub-reports, then three nodes appear. The node is based on the sub-report in Browse mode. Each node is clickable to Drilldown to the sub-reports. For drawing the nodes, you need a template containing the images references. If there is not a template or if the template does not contain references to the sub-report, the interface uses the sub-reports icon. Drilldown mode displays reports that are one level below the topology report to prohibit edges from displaying. |
| Custom           | The topology custom mode report is configured in XML files. You must place the XML file in the topomap directory of the WebApps-Resources module. For example, <APG>/Custom/WebApps- Resources/Default/topomap .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Topology Service | Uses the Topology service to generate the nodes and relationships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Topology

Select a topology service that is configured for the frontend application. These are set in the web application's dedicated XML configuration (for example, in /opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/conf/Catalina/localhost/APG.xml on UNIX or in C:\Program Files\APG\Web-Servers\Tomcat\Default\conf\Catalina\localhost\APG.xml on Windows.)

## XML data retrieval

This defines how the XML describing the report is retrieved. In each case (file path or URL), dynamic values can be injected at runtime by using placeholders. To inject a property, use ${property}. For example: http://www.company.com/query? mydevice=${device}. For topology map services that support it, "hop-count" and "map-type" can also be specified with their default values, using @{hop-count[:default-value]} or @{map-type[:default-value]}. For example: http://www.company.com/ query?hopcount=@{hop-count:1}&amp;maplayer=@{map-type}.

## Layout

Use this setting to determine the layout of the report.

| Organic      | Positions the nodes based on a physics simulation of the interacting forces.   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Balloon      | Positions the child nodes radially around their parents.                       |
| Circular     | Positions the nodes in a circle.                                               |
| Hierarchical | Positions the nodes in a hierarchical structure.                               |
| Tree         | Positions the nodes in a tree structure with the parents at the top right.     |
| Manual       | This setting is only available in custom mode.                                 |
| Orthogonal   | Positions the nodes at right angles.                                           |

## Template

Use this setting to determine how the nodes and edges are drawn. For the simple and advanced modes, the id-ref of each node is the same as the class. For Drilldown mode, the id-ref is the sub-report in Edit mode. For example, if you have a sub-report named "Router" and you perform an expansion on it, then each node of this expansion has the id-ref set to "Router."

If you select more than one template and the same node is located in multiple templates, only one is valid.

For the edge part of the simple and advanced mode, the id-ref is formatted as Source.Relation. Destination.

## Overlays

## Name

Assign a name for the overlay. The name appears on a menu of layers and overlays that are displayed on each Topology report.

## Display

## Templates

The value visible causes the overlay to be displayed by default on the Topology report. The value that is hidden causes the overlay to be hidden by default.

Use the pencil icon to display a list of templates. Select the template in which overlays are defined.

## Overlay reports

Overlay reports define additional layers to a graph report where events are plotted. You define the events to appear in a graph in a table report.

An overlay report is a mixed report because it displays the child graph report and the child table report on the same page.

In Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the overlay report from the mixed section.

## Configuration process

To configure an overlay report, do the following:

1. Add an overlay report node to the tree and configure it.
2. Configure a graph report as its child.
3. Configure a table report as its child, setting the events to appear in the graph.

## Overlay report parameters

You define the selection filter, the tooltip information, and the event attributes on the Report Details: Overlay tab.

## Display Title

The title does not appear in the reports but appears in the title of the overlay configuration box.

## Selection Filter

Filters events from the selected ones in the child table to appear in the overlay. This filter only contains additional properties because the table performs most of the filtering.

## Boundaries

Defines the zone in the graph where the events appear. It shows boundaries as percentages where zero is the bottom of the graph and 100 is the top. Use negative numbers to position the event zone below the graph. Use the slider for adjustments. Your selection appears with the overlay title at the top of its configuration box.

## Number of Lines

The number of lines to show the events in the graph. You can use one line per 10% of height. The result is alternating lines that are distributed vertically to plot the events.

## Main Color

The color value to use for the background of the whole zone. Set to white, #ffffff , to disable it.

## Display Level

Events and time series are rendered on top of one another. This setting determines how to arrange events and time series in an overlay. To draw overlays under the graph lines, use a negative value. To order different overlays, use numbers for the respective display levels to arrange them from the lowest value to the highest value. You can also use top or bottom as shortcuts for min and max. If multiple overlays overlap, you can choose the order in which they appear, as they are drawn from the lowest value to the highest.

## Display Mode

The way to render events. Depending on your selection, settings for events with duration are toggled to display those applicable to lines, dots, or areas.

NOTE:

## Event Limit

The maximum number of events that are displayed in the overlay. Events are displayed using the table order, and after the limit is reached, the rest of the events are not displayed.

## Tooltip Title

The name of the property whose value is the tooltip title.

## Events Color

The HTML color code for momentary events.

## Point Size

The size of the points for momentary events.

## Marker Type

The type of marker for momentary events.

## Events Color

The HTML color code for durable events.

## Line Width

The line width for events with duration.

## Line Style

The line style for events with duration.

## Dot Size

The size of the dots for durable dot type events.

## Start Marker

The marker for the start of events with duration.

## End Marker

The end marker for events with duration.

In Display Mode , when Dot is selected, the child table report will not be available.

## Marker Type

The type of marker for dot type durable events.

## Status reports

A status report aggregates data for each child node using a selected function over a time period. Each child node displays as a color symbol that can show its aggregated value and node name. It enables you to quickly view the status of nodes in relationship to one another, such as their average CPU utilization.

You select the size and symbol to use for the child nodes as well as the thresholds and their colors.

In Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the status report from the aggregated section.

## Status report parameters

You set how you want information presented in a status report on the Report Details: Status tab .

## Marker Type

Sets the size and symbol to use when reporting on the child nodes. The size values are:

| Nano   | Generates a high-density color-coded status report that is similar to a heat map. It shows the aggregated value and node name in a tooltip. This is the smallest size for a symbol.   |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Micro  | Generates a high-density color-coded status report that is similar to a heat map. It shows the aggregated value and node name in a tooltip.                                           |
| Small  | Generates a color-coded status report with small status symbols, each displaying its aggregated value and node name.                                                                  |
| Medium | Generates a color-coded status report with medium status symbols, each displaying its aggregated value and node name.                                                                 |
| Large  | Generates a color-coded status report with large status symbols, each displaying its aggregated value and node name.                                                                  |

## Show Value

Indicates whether to display the aggregated value inside the symbol and whether to round this value.

## Scaling Mode

If the unit of the values does not correspond to what you want to display, select multiply or divide from this list. In the corresponding field, you can then type the factor to apply, which allows you to change from bytes to kilobytes, for example.

## Order

Indicates whether to show the child nodes in ascending or descending order.

## Top N Mode

Defines whether to display all the status symbols in a report or a certain number that you specify here.

## Thresholds Definition

Thresholds do not appear in the report unless you give them values. You can add as many thresholds as necessary, giving each a different value and color. If there is a second y-axis in the graph, the thresholds you set here are applicable only to the main y-axis.

## Tooltip Information

Tooltips appear when the user hovers the cursor over a status icon. A tooltip displays one or more property values and, optionally, property names. You specify the properties that appear.

Click Add to add a new property to the tooltips. Two fields appear.

- In the first field, type a database property name or click the property selection helper and select a property from the list.
- In the second field, specify the label to appear with the value in the tooltip.

| Default   | Uses the system default name, as shown in the property selection helper .   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| None      | Does not use a label.                                                       |
| Custom    | Lets you supply the label.                                                  |

## Using threshold definitions

Setting a threshold enables you to visually see when a value has exceeded a threshold in a report.

Threshold definitions can be used in almost all report types. With thresholds, you can set a threshold value and assign it a color to represent that threshold. You can define as many thresholds as you need.

In typical graphs, thresholds appear as dotted lines at the defined values and with the corresponding colors, along with an explanation of each threshold in the legend so you can gauge values that have crossed your defined threshold. In graphs where there is a second y-axis, the thresholds only apply to the main y-axis.

In tables, status tree map reports, and heat map reports, values that fall within a severity range appear in the selected color or display the related severity icon.

Thresholds define the value of the lower boundary of a severity range. The higher boundary of the range is defined by the next highest threshold value. Inclusion of the boundary values in the range is based on severity of the range. The highest severity always wins the boundary value.

You can define ascending (higher value is more critical) severity, descending (lower value is more critical) severity, or a combination of both ascending and descending severities, as shown in the following examples:

## Example 1: As a value increases, the severity increases

Suppose that you want to set the following thresholds for a CPU utilization value:

- Normal for any value less than 20% utilization

- Minor for any value equal to or greater than 20% and less than 50% utilization
- Major for any value equal to or greater than 50% and less than 80% utilization
- Critical for any value equal to or greater than 80% utilization

The thresholds would be set as follows:

- Normal : -Infinity

- Minor : 20

- Major : 50

- Critical : 80

## Example 2: As a value decreases, the severity increases

Suppose that you want to set the following thresholds for a free space on disk value:

- Critical for any value equal to or less than 20 GB
- Major for any value greater than 20 GB and less than or equal to 30 GB
- Minor for any value greater than 30 GB and less than or equal to 80 GB
- Normal for any value equal to or greater than 80 GB

The thresholds would be set as follows:

- Critical : -Infinity
- Major : 20
- Minor : 30
- Normal : 80

## Example 3: As a value increases or decreases too much, the severity increases

Suppose that you want to set the following thresholds for a packet jitter value (which can be positive or negative):

- Unknown for any value less than -30 ms
- Critical for any value equal to or greater than -30 ms and less than -15 ms
- Major for any value equal to or greater than -15 ms and less than -10 ms
- Minor for any value equal to or greater than -10 ms and less than -5 ms
- Normal for any value equal to or greater than -5 ms and less than 5 ms
- Minor for any value equal to or greater than 5 ms and less than 10 ms
- Major for any value equal to or greater than 10 ms and less than 15 ms
- Critical for any value equal to or greater than 15 ms and less than 30 ms
- Unknown for any value greater than 30 ms

The thresholds would be set as follows:

- Unknown : -Infinity

- Critical : -30

- Major : -15

- Minor : -10

- Normal : -5

- Minor : 5

- Major : 10

- Criticial : 15

- Unknown : 30

## Example 4: Using a Custom severity

A standard severity has a fixed level. In increasing order (from lower to higher), the highest severity always gains the range border values:

- Undefined
- Normal
- Informational
- Unknown

- Minor
- Major
- Critical

For example, if you have the following threshold definitions:

- Major : -Infinity

- Minor : 0

- Critical : 10

Then the following ranges are defined:

- Major : -Infinity &lt;= value &lt;=0

- Minor : 0 &lt; value &lt; 10

- Critical : 10 &lt;= value

The range that has the Minor severity does not own the values 0 and 10 because the Minor severity is less than Major (which owns 0) and Critical (which owns 10).

Unlike a standard severity, a Custom severity is not fixed, it is the same as the severity of the range that is defined before it (in terms of value range). For example, if you have the following thresholds set in a table:

- Major
- : -Infinity
- Minor

: 0

- Custom : 5
- Major : 10

Then the following ranges are defined:

- â

- Major : -Infinity &lt;= value &lt;= 0

- Minor : 0 &lt; value &lt; 5

- Custom : 5 &lt;= value &lt; 10

- Major : 10 &lt;= value

The Custom range has the same severity level as the one set in the range defined before it (Minor). This is why the range using the Custom severity "owns" value 5 but not value 10 (which is owned by a range which has a higher severity: Major).

Mixing standard and Custom thresholds is not recommended.

If you use only Custom severities in all ranges, the behavior is constant because the actual severities are the same. For example, suppose the following thresholds are defined:

- Custom 1 : -Infinity
- Custom 2 : 0
- Custom 3 : 100

Then the following ranges that are defined:

- Custom 1 : -Infinity &lt;= value &lt; 0
- Custom 2 : 0 &lt;= value &lt; 100
- Custom 3 : 100 &lt;= value

If you define ranges with increasing severity:

- Normal : -Infinity

- Minor : 0

- Major : 100

- Critical : 1000

Then the following ranges are defined:

- Normal : -Infinity &lt;= value &lt; 0
- Minor : 0 &lt;= value &lt; 100
- Major : 100 &lt;= value &lt; 1000
- Critical : 1000 &lt;= value

If you define ranges with decreasing severity:

- Critical : -Infinity

- Major : 0

- Minor : 100

- Normal : 1000

Then the following ranges are defined:

- Critical : -Infinity &lt; value &lt;= 0
- Major : 0 &lt; value &lt;= 100
- Minor : 100 &lt; value &lt;= 1000
- Normal : 1000 &lt; value

The highest severity always wins the border value.

## Formula tab

You can apply formulas to any node of the tree to perform advanced computations on any number of values. All formulas have at least one result, and each result has additional options for displaying them in different contexts.

Where you use formulas depends on the type of report and the hierarchy of its nodes. When applying a formula to a node, you can plot its result on a graph, insert it into another formula, pass it to another report node, display it in child-based parent report, and display it in a value column in a table on a parent node.

Results can vary when applying formulas to nodes that are subject to an expansion. Depending on the formula type, the aggregation of input parameters from child nodes in a formula can apply to their parent node. You can then view the results in the parent node as an aggregation of the results that are returned by the child nodes.

By using the report editing tools, you can copy formulas from one report to another report.

## Handling formula results

The way that you apply formulas depends on how you want to process the results:

- If you want to plot the results of a formula on a simple chart or bar chart for a node, you can apply the formula to the node.
- If you want to use the results of a formula in a table report, apply the formula to a child of the parent table report node.
- You can use formula results from the current node or direct children as parameter inputs on the current node. It lets you add several formulas to a node whose results are combined.
- If you want to use the results of a formula in any child-based report, such as a child-based chart or stacked bars, apply the formula to a child of the node of one of these report types.
- If you want to pass the results of a child node to a parent of the current node, you can apply a formula to the current node. You can apply formulas to nodes in a hierarchy to pass the results further up the tree until you can access them at the desired node level.

## Formula parameters

You can add predefined formulas on the Formula tab and then customize them according to your reporting requirements.

## Parameter

The parameter values can be over an interval of time defined in the formula, such as the results of a filter or a child formula. Not all formulas have parameters to type.

| Filter on this Node   | Uses a standard filter to select the parameter to use. Values are subject to the filter of the current node, its parent nodes, and any other filters applied to the user or role. You can select any filter, but there can be specific values that are required.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Formula Result        | Uses the result from a formula as the parameter. A list appears that displays the available results you can use. â On a child node: Results from formulas of nodes that are direct children of the current node. â On the current node: Results from other formulas on the current node, which can be used as a parameter value for this formula. Result names are taken from the default name the formula gives the result or the name you give the result.                |
| Constant Value        | Types a float value to use as a constant input such as 3.0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Property Value        | Click the Property Selection Helper icon and select a property whose value is the input parameter. You can select only one property to type. You can also type a property name in the Property field. Property values either register as a numeric value, or if not possible, do not return a value.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Combined Parameters   | Enables you to combine parameter instances and types of Filter on this Node, Formula Result, Constant Value, or Property Value. How the combined parameters are treated depends on the formula. Usually they are aggregated spatially using the inherited report duration and aggregation settings, or by the time settings defined in the formula. Some formulas treat combined parameters in other ways. See the formula and parameter descriptions for more information. |
| Empty Parameter       | The parameter has no value (null).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Attach properties     | Enables you to attach the specified properties from the node to a parameter. If this parameter has a filter, it is also applied to the properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Setting

These are constant values used by the formula. You can change the default settings. It can determine, for example, the time range of the report, values that determine SLA objectives and settings that affect the aggregation that the formula uses. Not all formulas have settings.

## Result

The results that are returned by the formula. Each result has a default name that you can edit. They are used for these purposes:

- In the legend of graphs to identify each result if Show in Graphs is enabled for them.
- To identify the result when using it as an input parameter for another formula, and when displaying it in a value column of a parent node table report.

Names must be unique. If there are two results with the same name and you want to display the results in a parent table report, only one instance of the name is available, and the result displayed is the aggregate of the formula results with this name. Result names are case-sensitive so you can change the capitalization to differentiate results.

| Show in graphs   | For simple chart and bar chart graphs, if you select show in graphs for a formula result, the metrics of the node are not displayed. Only the formula results you enabled show.                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default results  | You can choose one result from the results for all the formulas on the node to display in a direct parent report that is a child-based report. To do this, select default result for the result. If the result is applied on an expansion, the result that is plotted in the parent node is an aggregation of all child results. |

You can pass a node's result to other nodes higher in the hierarchy to use in other formulas. The child result of the current node is passed to the parent. You can also pass a result to another formula on the same node.

## Copying a formula

You can copy and paste formula definitions from one report definition to another report definition.

## Steps

1. Browse to the report that contains the formula you want to copy.
2. Click the Report Details: Formula tab.
3. Check the formulas that you want to copy.
4. Click Copy .
5. Browse to the report where you want to paste the formula.
6. Click the Report Details: Formula tab.
7. Click Paste .

8. Click Save .

## UI interactivity and table interactivity tabs

The interactivity parameters control the results when the user clicks the elements in the report.

Three levels of interactivity are provided.

## Default behavior

Check or clear these parameters to switch them on or off. The underlying actions are preconfigured and not editable.

- Default pass through sends events that are performed on a child report to the mixed report.
- Drilldown on row click enables or disables a go to a more detailed report when the user clicks a row in a table report.
- Drilldown on title click enables or disables the go to the full page report when the user clicks the title of a report. For example, a mixed report or list report contains titles to other reports.
- Action Menu enables or disables the context pop-up menus that exist on some reports. For example, the alerting reports have a context menu for managing alerts. When there is no context menu, the installed default is cleared.
- Allow multiple row selection enables or disables the appearance of the checkbox column as the first column in a table report.

<!-- image -->

NOTE: This field controls whether the multi-row selection column appears. Customization activity is required to associate actions with the checkbox column.

## Custom behavior

Click buttons in this section to configure custom behavior. Jump to report links an element in a report to another report. The Destination Report Path includes the UID, the node path of the report you are linking to, and optionally, expressions that filter the initial display of the report. For an example report path, click the information icon next to the Destination Report Path field.

Custom triggers and adapters

Click Switch to Advanced Mode to expose additional customization features. You can create custom triggers for interactive actions and custom adapters to handle additional actions.

## Enable multi-row selection and action menu

You can configure an existing action menu to respond to multiple row selections.

## Prerequisites

This procedure assumes that the action menu is already defined and associated to the report.

## About this task

By default, a right-click action menu applies to a single row. For example, in any alerting report, right-click text in a row to view and use the action menu.

This procedure enables the action on multiple rows.

## Steps

1. Browse to the table report that has an action menu that is associated with rows.
2. In Edit Mode , click Table Interactivity .
3. Select the following fields:
- Action Menu (should already be enabled)
- Allow Multiple Row Selection
4. Click Save

.

5. Click Browse Mode .

Notice that the column of checkboxes is now visible.

6. Test whether the action menu operates on multiple rows:
- a. Select the checkboxes on several rows.
- b. Right-click the text in one of the selected rows.
- If the action menu appears, the feature is operational. You can exit the menu and clear the selection for rows.
- If the message No actions available appears, go to the next step.
7. At the command line for the Frontend server, browse to the following folder:

&lt;APG&gt;/Custom/WebApps-Resources/Default/actions/

8. Open the XML file for the appropriate action menu. For example, the default alerting context menu is defined in eventmgmt.xml .
9. Add the multiple attribute to the &lt;script&gt; element as shown here:

&lt;script file="ack-event" result="notification" timeout="10000" multiple="multipleexecution"&gt;

10. Save the file and retest.

## Pre-Generation tab

Pre-generated reports are reports that are automatically generated on a predetermined schedule. Pre-generated reports can save users time when they are used to generate reports that take a long time to process. Only administrators can create pre-generated reports. This tab is not available for reports under My Reports .

## Steps

1. In Edit mode, click the Pre-Generation tab.
2. Click New Pre-Generated Report.
3. In Schedule this report for , select the user or role for which the report is to be generated.

The assigned role requires at least one internal user: if the role has only externally authenticated users or no users at all, the report is not generated.

4. In Name , type a name for the report.
5. Use the Schedule options to select the time to generate the report.
6. Select the instances of this report to generate.

For example, if a report node has been copied and placed somewhere else in the tree, this menu allows both of those nodes to be generated.

7. Check to send an email about the report generation to the selected recipient.

NOTE: As per the SRM Reporting framework design,

- The last stored pre-generated report is listed with session logout and login.
- From Edit Reports &gt; Pregeneration Report tab is supported only from the parent node.
- The time range added for the parent node gets carried out for all the child nodes during stored report generation.

## Report URL Syntax

The reports in the interface are available to third-party client tools that use the URL syntax.

## URLs

The base URL is: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/?param=value&amp;param=value The URL to display reports on a full page is: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/report.jsp? param=value&amp;param=value

The URL to display reports in jpg, png, pdf, svg, xls, and csv formats are: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/ report. format ?param=value&amp;param=value

Replace format in the above URL with the desired format. For example: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/ report.csv?param=value&amp;param=value

## Defining custom colors

Custom colors are supported for custom threshold definitions and for text decorations.

## About this task

Custom colors are supported for the following definitions in Edit mode.

- The custom threshold type lets you define a custom color.
- Text decorations and backgrounds in table columns let you define custom colors.

In the above field definitions, when you click the color patch next to the field, the custom color map appears. In other situations where the color is fixed, clicking the color patch does not open the color map.

The colors that are associated with threshold severity levels are fixed as follows:

- Normal - Green
- Critical - Red
- Major - Orange
- Minor - Yellow
- Informational - Blue
- Unknown - Gray

Use the following procedure to use the color map to define a custom color.

## Steps

1. Click the color patch in a location where a custom color is supported.

The color map appears.

<!-- image -->

2. Slide the arrows on the color bar to choose the color family.
3. Drag the white circle to a location on the color map to fine-tune the color within the family.

You can also use the code designations to define the color if you know them.

4. Click Apply .
5. To reuse a defined custom color in another definition, copy the HEX color code in the # field and paste the value into the same field in the new definition.

## Accessing reports from outside of the Console

You might want to bookmark a report, include the report or its URL in another document or email, or have a third-party application access and display the most current version of a report.

The following methods for accessing a report from outside of the Console are supported:

- Copy the URL of a displayed report in the Console, and save it for use elsewhere.
- Use the Frontend Report Lookup tool to access a report using unique IDs and report paths.
- Construct a URL using supported parameters.

## Getting the complete URL for the current report

With the complete URL of a report, you can email the link to a report or bookmark the report in your browser.

## Steps

1. Click Tools &gt; Show Report URL . The URL for the currently displayed report appears in a dialog box.
2. Copy the URL.

## Report URL Syntax

The reports in the interface are available to third-party client tools that use the URL syntax.

## URLs

The base URL is: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/?param=value&amp;param=value

The URL to display reports on a full page is: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/report.jsp? param=value&amp;param=value

The URL to display reports in jpg, png, pdf, svg, xls, and csv formats are: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/ report. format ?param=value&amp;param=value

Replace format in the above URL with the desired format. For example: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/ report.csv?param=value&amp;param=value

## Find and Fix Broken Links in Reports

The Broken Links Detection Tool scans the entire report tree and identifies all report links that cannot be resolved. It fixes links if possible and provides best guess suggestions for resolving others.

## About this task

## Reasons for broken links

## Fixing broken links

## Steps

1.

On

APG

page, click

As reports are moved, removed, updated, or disabled in the report tree, links to those reports from other reports must be changed. The old links no longer work. Also, pregenerated reports and reports in the My Reports node, such as pinned reports, scheduled reports, and favorite reports are based on links that might be broken when reports are moved, removed, or disabled. Changed UIDs result in breaking links to reports that were linked or hooked to the original UIDs. SolutionPack upgrades that include moved or updated reports can impact links. For this reason, whenever a SolutionPack upgrade occurs, the upgrade process schedules the Broken Links Detection Tool to run after a timed waiting period. If you are sequencing multiple SolutionPack upgrades closely together, the waiting period is moved out with each upgrade, so that the Broken Links Detection Tool runs only once after all the upgrades seem to be finished. You can run the Broken Links Detection Tool on demand at any time.

The tool fixes many broken lines during its execution. These links are known with 100% certainty to be remapped to other locations. The tool does not show the automatically fixed links. If you are interested in viewing them, you can change the logging level of the daily Tomcat log file. For suggested fixes that do not rate a 100% confidence, the tool presents you with the pathname of the broken link, a suggested path for fixing the link that is based on certain assumptions, and a confidence percentage for how accurate the suggestion might be. You can select whether you want to apply the suggested fix, and the tool applies the fix. If you believe that the suggestion is incorrect, or if there is no suggestion that is provided, you must manually fix the link. The following procedure describes how to run the tool and how to resolve the detected broken links that were not fixed automatically by the tool.

4. Analyze the suggestion in each row.
5. To accept a suggestion, click the box in the first column.
6. Click Apply Fixes .
7. When a suggestion is not correct or when there is no suggestion at all, manually fix the link as follows:
- a. Click the Go To icon in the Name/Location column.
- b. Use any of the following suggestions to manually correct the link path:
- For Scheduled Reports, Pinned Reports, and Favorites, it is easiest to re-create the link using the User Interface, and delete the outdated report.
- Correct a link manually: Click Modifications &gt; Edit Reports , and change either the incorrect UID or the incorrect report path in the report definition. There are various places in a report definition where a link to another report might occur. Save the change, and return to Browse Mode.
- If there are many reports linking to the same report path, and that report path is not being found, causing many failures for the same reason, consider the following approach: Revert to the previous version, add a UID to the report that is not being found, then upgrade, add the same UID into the report definitions in the new location, and run the tool again. Analyze whether this advanced approach is better than correcting each link manually.
8. Rerun the Link Detection Tool.
9. Repeat these steps until all broken links are fixed.

## View Fixed Links in Tomcat Logs

If the logging level is set to FINE or FINEST , fixed links are logged in the daily Tomcat log file.

## About this task

By default, the logging level does not produce information about fixed links, so change the logging level. More log entries increase I/O activity and can impact performance.

The log file name is catalina.&lt;date stamp&gt;.log at the Frontend server here:

```
com.emc.mnr.links.level=ALL
```

1catalina.com.watch4net.apg.logging.jul.handler.RotateFileHandler.level = FINE

- e. Change FINE to FINEST .
- f. Save the file.
- g. Restart Tomcat.
- h. Rerun the Detect and Fix Links tool to start capturing the additional log entries.
4. To view the log entries:
- a. Expand the Log Files blue bar.
- b. Download or view a catalina.&lt;date stamp&gt;.log file.

## Managing users and user rights

A global administrator can assign access rights to users and groups to control what they can see and do in the interface.

## Roles

Roles group users together to help you manage access to reports, modules, and functionality, such as report editing and report searching. You can also assign administrative tasks to a role.

You assign a user to a role when creating or modifying a user account or a role. There are several default roles that you can use and you can create your own roles. You can assign a user to one or more roles.

If you do not assign a user to a role, the user only sees the Scheduled Reports, Stored Reports, and Favorite Reports branches in the report tree.

## Inheritance of privileges

You can define a parent-child relationship in which one role inherits the privileges of another role. In this relationship, the child role uses the parent access rights and restrictions for viewing reports and components and using functionality.

## Primary filter

A primary file provides you an additional layer to manage access to metrics shown on reports. You can set up a primary filter to restrict the users of a role from viewing certain metrics on reports.

You can also define a primary filter for a particular user, which is combined with the group's primary filter to place more viewing restrictions on that user.

## Profiles

A user contains personal information, such as login credentials. You associate a user with a profile to define the global characteristics of a user, such as language and time zone. Users are automatically assigned to the default profile, but you can add profiles according to your company's global reporting requirements.

## Advanced mode

You perform most user management functions in standard mode. However, to establish inheritance between roles, assign administration tasks to a role, and reset default roles to their original settings, you must use advanced mode.

## User Management

A user account and associated password are required to log in the system. A user account can be shared, and multiple online sessions can log in with the same account simultaneously.

The User Management page lists all user accounts, their status, their profile, whether the profile is enabled, and some optional information about the user, such as name and email address. From this page, you can add new user accounts and edit existing user accounts.

The User Management page also lists the number of days left for password expiry as well as the last accessed date of the user.

## Adding a user

When you add a user, you set the login credentials and email address in which to send notifications about reports.

## Steps

1. Click Administration &gt; USERS &amp; SECURITY &gt; Manage Users .
2. Click New user .
3. On the User Data tab, type the User Login .

This value is case-sensitive.

4. Type and confirm the password.
5. Select the Title of the user.
6. Type the First Name and the Last Name of the user.
7. Type the Email Address . This address receives notifications about reports, such as when a certain report is generated.
8. Click Save .

A user can override these settings on the User Settings page.

## Setting the access rights of a user

You can indicate whether a user is a Global Administrator with full privileges or a Normal User in which you can assign access rights to reports, components, and report templates using roles.

|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Normal User          | Default status for all users. You can set various access restrictions on components and reports on a normal user. |
| Global Administrator | Full access to all components and reports. You cannot disable a global administrator from login.                  |
| Vault User           | User credentials are managed by CyberArk. This is applicable only to CyberArk Password Management.                |

This is useful when performing maintenance.

6. If you want to hide the New Feature dialog, check Hide New Feature Dialog? .
7. Select the Profile for the user.

The user is automatically added to the default profile if you have not created any profile.

8. Use Add Role to assign the user to a default role or other roles that you created. The role that you assign the user determines which reports a user can see and modify. The Full Control Users default role enables a user to access and modify all available reports in the tree as well as access most modules and tools.

## Authentication Management

User authentication is achieved through realms.

A realm defines how user credentials are obtained and checked. A realm defines the connection, access, and search parameters that are required for authentication.

The default realm is the local realm, which accesses credentials that are stored in the Dell SRM database. You can configure several realms and specify the order that they are used for credential verification.

NOTE: For more information about LDAP authentication, see Dell SRM Administration Guide.

## Testing authentication

You can test authentication settings to test the connectivity to the realm.

2. In Authentication Type , select the authentication type you want to test.
3. Click Test Authentication .
4. Type the User Name and Password .
5. Click Test Authentication to verify user authentication.

## Adding realms

You can add realms to define a new authentication source or to enable authentication-related features.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; USERS &amp; SECURITY &gt; Authentication &gt; Authentication Settings . The Authentication Settings dialog box appears.

Two realms are provided by default after installation:

- Local
- LockoutRealm
2. Click Add a Realm .

The following realm types are supported:

Table 26. Realm types

| Type         | Description                                                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local        | Obtains user credentials from the user accounts stored in the Dell SRM database. |
| LDAP         | Obtains user credentials from an LDAP server. LDAPS is also supported.           |
| RoleLock     | Prevents users who do not have specific roles from logging in.                   |
| LockOutRealm | Prevents users who have too many authentication attempts from logging in.        |
| Keystone     | Uses the OpenStack identity service.                                             |
| Custom       | Uses other credential sources.                                                   |

3. Select an Authentication Type .
2. NOTE:
- The Local realm authenticates from usernames and passwords that are configured in Dell SRM. The Local realm is the default authentication method that is activated after installation. It does not require any additional configurations. If you configure an external database, such as Active Directory, for authentication, you still need at least one local user account, with global administrator rights, that matches a domain account.
- For more information about LDAP configuration, see Dell SRM Administration Guide.
4. Click Test Authentication to test connectivity to the realm.
5. If authentication failed, check configured property values or add additional properties as needed for the realm, and retest connectivity.
6. Click Save .

## Server Management

The Physical and Logical server overviews enable you to configure, monitor, and manage the servers in the deployment.

After you register the first server, Server and Modules connects to it and retrieves information such as the server status, the modules that are installed on it, and provides access to it through the navigation tree.

## Physical Overview

The Physical Overview displays the registered servers and the modules that are installed on each server in a Table View . The table displays the server name, average health, CPU utilization, memory utilization, and file system utilization percentage value in different columns of the table. The tool tip on the column name indicates the data range for the presented value. To sort the table according to any of the parameters, click the sorting icon in each column of the table. Sparklines for metrics next to data values give a sense of the pattern of the metric values. You can also change the table view to graph view.

To get more details about a server, click on name of the server. The charts at the top of the page can be configured to display a combination of historical data and real-time data.

## Logical Overview

The Logical Overview shows the distribution of the modules based on their categories. To get more details about a module, click the module's name.

Each module page provides:

- Module properties - category, name, version, instance name, install path, and description
- Service status - displays the service status and enables you to stop, start, and restart a service
- Configuration files - enables you to view and edit the module configuration files
- Log files - enables you to view and tail module log files

## Registering additional servers

This topic describes how to register remote servers using SRM Admin UI.

## Prerequisites

The additional server must be installed.

## Steps

1. Click Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Settings .
2. Click Configure Servers .
3. Click Register a Server .
4. Type the following server details:

- Server HostName - links the server to a device in the APG database. To get historical data for the device, Dell Technologies recommends using the same name that is used by APG, which is the server hostname. You can confirm it by looking at APG Health reports in the Frontend. Server HostName is also used as the server display name if you do not create an alias.
- Server Alias - customizes the server display name in Admin UI without any other impact. If you do not create a Server Alias, the hostname is used.
- Server Description - is displayed on the Centralized Management home page in the Physical Overview under each server name. It can be left blank or used to describe a server role.
- WS Gateway URL - contains the URL that points to the remote WebService Gateway. The default configuration is: https://server.name.or.ip:48443/. The WebService Gateway service must be running on the remote server for this to be working.
- WS Gateway Username - is the one from the Gateway credentials. It is configured at its level, and described in its own documentation. Default value is Admin.
- WS Gateway Password - is the one from the Gateway credentials. It is configured at its level, and described in its own documentation. Default value is changeme. On an already configured server, Password field is never displayed again. There is no need to fill it before saving: if left blank, it is removed, but rather left untouched. The only means to empty a saved password is to empty the username as well.
- SSL Validation - can be checked to validate the SSL certification before instantiating communication. When using a self-signed certificate, it should be left cleared. When using a certificate recognized by a certificate authority, it should be checked.
- Operating System - are used to select the packages to send and use on this server. Be sure to set it to the correct value, as setting it to a wrong value causes invalid or corrupted installations.
- Health Values - optional, configures the type of data that are recovered and displayed for this server. Real-time data is collected through the APG Self-Monitoring Collector which provides real-time access to the server metrics. Historical data is retrieved from the usual APG databases and is also based on the metrics that are collected by that collector. Databases are defined in the web application context file. See the section on page 61. The physical overview displays historical data if it is enabled. The per-server view displays real-time data if it is enabled, and if not it falls back to historical data. If it is disabled, charts are hidden.
- Report in Dell M&amp;R - optional, can be used as a shortcut to access a report in the APG frontend. Type the targeted URL and this creates a link to it in the global physical overview. For example, http://apg.server.name.or.ip:58080/APG/ #0-4-52664238.
- Server Tags - adds the ability to specify string tags for servers. Tags provide useful information about a server that helps to select the recommended server for installing a SolutionPack component. For example, a server tag could be the last part of the ID of a SolutionPack component, such as "collect." A SolutionPack component with the ID emc-vnx-collect would be installed on a server with the tag "collect."

## Removing additional servers

This topic describes how to remove remote servers using SRM Admin UI.

## Prerequisites

If a scaled-out collector is no longer in use, you can unregister from the existing Dell SRM deployment, and remove the vApp.

## Steps

1. SRM Admin page &gt; Configure Servers &gt; Delete the unwanted server (scaled-out collector) &gt; SAVE .
2. NOTE: There is no confirmation notification for the deletion and the server will removed at the instant the bin icon is clicked.
2. Login to the Collector console using root, run # manage-modules.sh service remove all
3. Power off the VM.
4. Delete from the disk.

NOTE: This MUST only be performed on a scaled-out VM (Collector host) that is no longer in use/required.

## Distribute startup of UNIX services

During a system startup on UNIX servers, problems can occur if all services try to start simultaneously. You can distribute service startup by editing the conf/unix-service.properties files for each service.

## Prerequisites

This procedure only applies to UNIX configurations.

## Steps

1. Click Administration .
2. Under System Admin &gt; Servers &amp; Modules &gt; Services , browse to a service name.

For example, collector-managers are services.

3. In the right pane, expand the blue bar for Configuration files .
4. Locate the conf/unix-service.properties file, and click the Edit (pencil) icon on the row.

In a long list of files, it might be on the second page.

5. Locate lines similar to the following in the middle of the file:
6. After start.param.2 , add the following parameter

```
start.mode=java start.target=com.watch4net.apg.v2.collector.Bootstrap start.param.1=main start.param.2=start stop.mode=kill # timeout is in seconds stop.timeout=60
```

```
start.delay= n
```

where n is the number of seconds to delay the start of this service on system startup.

For example:

```
start.mode=java start.target=com.watch4net.apg.v2.collector.Bootstrap start.param.1=main start.param.2=start start.delay=40 stop.mode=kill # timeout is in seconds stop.timeout=60
```

7. Repeat these steps for each service, altering the start.delay value for each service to create a smooth startup.
8. Click Save .

## Starting and stopping services

The services panel displays the modules that have a service configuration, including those modules whose service entry has been removed.

## About this task

The services table displays the module information, its current service status, and an estimate of its last status change. The status column can have multiple values depending on both the service properties and its current state:

- Started - the service is currently running.
- Stopped - the service has been stopped.
- Not installed - the service has been removed and is no longer available.
- Unknown - the current status cannot be determined. This is usually caused by a service that requires administrative privileges to run, such as the Collector Manager when you use the ICMP Collector on UNIX.

If the Start , Stop , and Restart buttons are not available, the service cannot be managed through Centralized Management UI.

- No button visible - occurs on a service that needs to be running to access the server; as a consequence, it cannot be started, stopped, or restarted. You must manually connect to the server using SSH or a remote desktop to perform these operations, for example the Webservices Gateway module.
- All buttons are grayed - Centralized Management UI does not have enough rights to perform operations on this service. This can apply to any service that requires administration privileges, such as the Collector Manager when running the ICMP Collector.
- Only a restart button - this occurs when looking at the Tomcat server that is used to run Centralized Management UI. The restart command is available, but if it were to fail, you must manually connect to the server to fix the issue.

## Steps

1. Click Administration .
2. Click a server under System Admin &gt; Servers &amp; Modules &gt; Services .
3. Click the service you want to stop or start.
4. Click Start , Stop , or Restart .

## Installing modules

5. Click Launch . The Module Installation dialog box appears.
6. Type an instance name.
7. Click Launch .

During the installation process, questions appear in the display. You must answer each question within five minutes or the module installation process is interrupted, which can cause an inconsistent state on the remote server for the module.

You can remove a module that has been installed by mistake or been moved to another server by clicking Uninstall .

## Updating modules

When new versions of a module are available, either by running the setup of a new release or by uploading new packages to the central repository, an update button is displayed on the module page.

## About this task

If different versions are available, the update button has the option to select the version you want.

## Steps

3. Click the Packs &amp; Modules tab. If the module has an update available, the Update to Latest Version button is displayed at the upper right corner of the

page.

4. Click Update to Latest Version .

## Accessing and editing configuration files

Using Servers and Modules, you can edit, upload, and remove module configuration files.

## About this task

Each module manages its own configuration files, even if the module is used within one another. For example, a collector or filter configuration that is used in a collector manager, is accessible only on the corresponding collector or filter page. The configuration files table only displays the files that are identified by the module as configuration files.

## Steps

1. Click Administration .
2. Use the Home and select server in the Physical Overview to browse to the module, service, or task whose configuration file you want to access.
3. Expand the Configuration Files block.
4. Click the pencil icon to open the configuration file.
5. Edit the file. Be careful when making changes. The configuration file is not checked to ensure that the changes you make are valid.
6. Click Save .

The file gets updated on the server.

## Viewing log files

Log files are useful to check on a module that has recently been started or to track down a specific error that has occurred.

## About this task

Log files are listed in the order of the last modification, so you usually want to review the first file in the table. The number of files is defined in the logging configuration file, which is called logging.properties.

## Steps

1. Click Administration &gt; Sytem Admin &gt; Log &amp; Diagnostics .
2. Use the Log Files tab to browse to the module for which you want to view the log.
3. Select the module for which you want to download the log files and click Download .

## Viewing module tasks

The Task Scheduler is a service that runs scheduled tasks. The Task Scheduler replaces cron on UNIX-based systems and Schedule Tasks on Windows servers. The Task Scheduler runs important tasks, such as refreshing the Frontend-Search index periodically, or performing database maintenance tasks to optimize performance. Scheduled tasks can be viewed for each module.

## About this task

A task has four parts:

- A schedule, which indicates the time of execution
- The maximum time the task can take to run
- An action to take on execution
- Locks that prevent tasks from running simultaneously

## Steps

1. Click Administration .
2. Use the Home and select server in the Physical Overview .
3. Click the Tasks tab.

A table of tasks shows run statistics and current task status.

4. Click a task to access the following:
- Configuration files for the task. You can view or edit the files.
- Log files for each execution of the task. It can help troubleshoot tasks that did not complete successfully.
- Disable button. You can cancel a pending task execution or interrupt it once it has started. There is no confirmation and the task is immediately canceled.
- Run now button. You can start execution immediately, rather than wait for the next scheduled run.

## Package management

Using Manage Packages, you can manage how packages are used when installing or updating modules.

A package is a module that is frozen at a certain code version. Packages are used to determine when new versions of modules are available and to install and update module instances. Modules are components of the core software, such as: backends, web servers, collectors (XML Collector, and SNMP Collector), and filters (Property Tagging Filter, and Cross-Referencing filter). Modules can be installed and managed separately. When a module is installed, that instance of the module has a unique instance name so that it can operate separately from other instances of the same module. By default, the name of a module instance is "Default." You can manage the installed packages at CONFIG &gt; Settings &gt; Manage Packages .

The Packages Listing displays the package names, versions, and operating systems. Operating system is important as it determines whether the package can be installed on a particular server or not. You can hover over the Status column to see where packages are installed. You can install a package multiple times on the same server.

## Package synchronization

Packages can be retrieved, cleaned up remotely, or discarded from the Manage Packages repository, which by default is located at Packages Listing.

Synchronization has the following options:

- Retrieve the last packages - connects to each server and fetches the latest version of their packages. It is the easiest way to install new packages as it runs the installer and then runs the synchronization.
- Retrieve all the packages - retrieves every available package from the servers, not just the latest ones. It is useful if you need a version that is not the most recent one.
- Remove remote packages - performs a cleanup of the remote servers. For each server, every package that is not installed on it is removed from its repository to free the disk space on the server.
- Remove old versions from repository - performs a cleanup on the Centralized Management UI package repository and keeps the most recent version of each package, and the versions that are currently installed on the remote servers.

A summary is displayed for each server with the count of globally added or removed packages and the file size. For example, on the central repository, adding two packages and removing five packages results in a count of negative three packages.

## Discovery Center

Discovery Center provides a central location to view and manage all devices which are monitored by the SolutionPacks. In Discovery Center, you can add new devices to be monitored, change device connection credentials and parameters, and test connectivity to devices.

Starting Dell SRM 4.5, Discovery Center is case insensitive. This feature is added to avoid discovery of the same device which can lead to discrepancies in reporting and also helps in avoiding redundant collection cycles. The Discovery Center search feature is case insensitive and displays the discovered devices irrespective of the case of Search text box. While trying to add devices, Discovery Center checks if the device is already present in any other case. If it is, the device is not added.

- Add feature would generate a message mentioning that Device is already present.
- Import CSV feature only allows device attributes to be changed, but a new device in a different case is not added.

There are several ways to add new devices:

- Add a single device manually
- Add devices in bulk by importing a CSV file
- Add devices using discovery

Discovery Center contains two sections:

- The Manage Discovery section is where you perform all add device and manage device activities.
- The Discovery Wizard section contains collector information that is required by the automatic discovery operations.

## Manage Discovery

The Manage Discovery is organized by device type. You perform all device management activities on this page.

The list of device types on the Manage Discovery page is based on the SolutionPacks that are installed.

Click a device type row to manage devices of that type. Management activities include:

- Review the list of devices that are actively being monitored.
- View and change connection credentials and other device-specific parameters.
- Test connectivity to each device.
- Add or delete devices.
- Backup device details

## Adding a new device manually

Using Discovery Center you can manually add a new device to be monitored.

## Prerequisites

To add a new device, you must already have a SolutionPack installed that supports that device type.

## Steps

1. Browse to Administration &gt; Discovery &gt; Manage Discovery .
2. Select the SolutionPack.
3. On the Collected Devices tab, click Add .
4. In the device configuration dialog box, type the parameters for the new device. The configuration dialog box is device-specific. See the product SolutionPack documentation for information about each

field.

5. Click Validate and add .

The validation tests connectivity to the device using the provided information. If an error indicator appears, correct the information and click Test to try again.

6. Click OK to confirm addition of device.
2. The new device appears in the Collected Devices table in blue and italicized, indicating that it is not yet saved in the system.
7. Click Save .
8. Click Ok to confirm the save.
9. Click Ok .

The Status column represents the discovery results. You can click the status icon to view the discovery results.

If the connectivity status is a green check, the new device is now being monitored.

## Adding devices using CSV files

You can import a properly formatted CSV file to add devices.

Each device type provides a template that describes the required format of the CSV file for the device type. You can also export existing devices into a CSV file.

## Importing a CSV file

You can import a CSV file containing information about new devices to be monitored.

## Prerequisites

- To import new devices, you must already have a SolutionPack installed that supports the device type to be imported.
- Due to the addition of fields Secure Vault and Unique Key in the Manage Discovery page, the older CSV files that are used for devices will not work. To import devices in Discovery Center, use the new CSV template from the Discovery Center and move the data from old CSV files to the new template.
- The fields Secure Vault and Unique Key should not be left empty in the CSV files during import. Use the default value * for Unique Key and false for Secure Vault, in case the values are not available.

## About this task

## Add devices using discovery

The discovery feature uses saved information in discovery groups to find new devices. A discovery group is specific to a device type.

The following procedures are required to implement discovery for a device type:

1. Register a collector server that supports discovery for the device type.

NOTE: The discovery method is supported by many, but not all, device types.

2. Create one or multiple discovery groups for the device type.
3. Trigger discovery for a discovery group.
4. Distribute the discovery results to the collector.

## Registering a new collector server

To use the automatic discovery features, you must first register the collector server that supports the device type you want to discover.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Settings &gt; Manage Discovery Backends . The table lists the system's Backend servers.
2. Click the row for a Backend server.

The collector servers that are registered to perform discovery are listed. The table also shows the discoverable device types that are supported by each collector server.

NOTE: If the table is empty, no collectors are registered.

3. To see a list of unregistered collector servers, click Register .
4. Select one or more servers from the list, and click Register . If you are collecting VMware vSphere vSAN &amp; VxRail events, select the primary backend that you want to use for

discovering the events.

When registration finishes, all the currently registered collectors are shown, with their supported discoverable device types.

## Create a discovery group

A discovery group stores the connection information, credentials, and other configuration information that is required to discover a group of devices. For example, you might set up discovery groups to store IP address ranges or subnets and appropriate connection credentials.

## Prerequisites

Before you can create discovery groups and use the discover feature, the collection server that is associated with the device type must be registered.

- If the Discovery Groups and Discovery Results tabs are grayed out, the collection server is not registered.
- If the Discovery Groups and Discovery Results tabs are not shown, discovery is not supported for the device type.

Review the devices and credentials to avoid lockout of devices due to multiple attempts of incorrect credentials. Dell Technologies recommends creating groups in such a way that devices have a minimal set of credentials to be tried against. Dell Technologies recommend using common public-private key pairs for multiple devices.

## Discovery Wizard

The Discovery Wizard is a tool to ease the initial deployment and configuration of the most commonly used Solution Packs.

After upgrading to Dell SRM 4.3, you may want to use the Discovery Wizard to quickly enable the Solution Packs and add the corresponding devices that you would like to report on.

Starting Dell SRM 4.5, Discovery Wizard is case insensitive for the supported SPs. This feature is added to avoid discovery of the same device which can lead to discrepancies in reporting and also helps in avoiding redundant collection cycles.

For more information about how to use the Discovery Wizard, see Dell SRM Installation and Configuration Guide.

## Back up device details

2. Click Backup Devices .
3. In the Configure FTP Details page, type the FTP Hostname and FTP port.
4. In the Folder Path , specify the path to save the exported device details.
5. NOTE: If no folder path is specified, a folder with the current date is created in the FTP server where the device details are saved.
5. Type a valid FTP server username and password.
6. Click Submit .

The FTP server details are configured and saved successfully.

- NOTE: After configuring the FTP server details, run the Backup Device Details scheduled tasks to export the list of devices. For more information about scheduled tasks, see Dell SRM Admin Guide.

## Groups Management

Groups Management is a data enrichment interface. It provides a quick way to add additional properties to collected records.

The Groups Management UI lets you create values for a preconfigured property. You also create the match rules (called membership rules in the UI) that filter collected records to of assign the new value to the matching records. For example, in the Customer group, you can create a Customer value and then create the rules defining which collected records should be enriched with the new value.

Predefined groups are installed with SolutionPacks that use them. For example, any of the SolutionPacks that support LUN service level tagging l install the Service Level by LUNs group. If none of the corresponding SolutionPacks are installed, you cannot see that group in your Groups Management node.

Each group is defined in a configuration file. These configuration files are used to specify the key-properties and new-properties for the Property-Tagging-Filter, the type of group (flat or hierarchical), and the properties to display in the Groups Management preview table. An advanced user can create a configuration file to create a group under the Groups Management node.

## Flat and hierarchical groups

A group type is either flat or hierarchical.

## Flat groups

In flat groups, collected data can match only one rule and the property being added can have only one value per matched database entry. The Service Levels by LUNs is an example of a flat group. The Service Level for a particular LUN can be gold or platinum, but not both. The Service Level property ( psvclvl ) can store only one value.

In a flat group type, the group names appear in a simple list. The order of the group names is important. The matching is performed in the order of the groups that are listed, and the first match wins.

## Hierarchical groups

In hierarchical groups, collected data can match one or more rules. As a consequence, the new property can store one or more values. These values are separated by pipes (|).

Platform is an example of a hierarchical group type. A particular device can match the rules for All Hosts and also for UNIX Hosts. Therefore, the stored property value could be "All Hosts|unix" .

- NOTE: A subgroup does not inherit the rules from its parent. The underlying rules must be constructed correctly to support the hierarchy.

The ordering of the rules does not matter in a hierarchical group.

## Summary of groups

The Groups Management UI supports a predefined set of group types, each with a predefined purpose. It is important to use and populate each group type according to its intended purpose.

The following table contains a high-level description and intended purpose for each of the group types that the Groups Management UI supports. Each group type tags collected data with one or more additional properties.

NOTE: The installation might not contain all these group types. SolutionPacks install them since they are using it.

Table 27. Summary of predefined group types

| Group type                                                                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Business Unit , Location , Customers , and Application                    | These four properties are used for filtering and reporting based on customer- defined attributes. Many reports contain predefined (but hidden) columns for these properties. Those same reports include predefined group filters for these properties, for easy filtering by selected customer, location, application or business unit values. Installations can use these four properties for any wanted purpose. For example, to track storage usage by applications, you might populate the Business Unit property with application names, and set up the rules to filter on storage assets that are used by specific applications. |

|    4 | Preview table          | The preview table lists a partial view of objects in the database that match the rules for a selected value. For example, with All Hypervisors selected, the preview table lists hypervisors but not physical hosts or VM guests.                                                                      |
|    5 | Export/ Import actions | These actions manage the underlying CSV file that is associated with this group type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Select a group name and then click Edit to see the match rules for that group name. For example, select All Hypervisors and click Edit to see the rules that control when the value All Hypervisors is assigned to the nodegrp property in a collected entry.

## Use the preview table

The preview table shows the members of a selected group and some additional information about the members.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Chargeback &amp; Service Levels &gt; Block Chargeback Grouping &gt; group\_type . The page opens with the preview table showing the first 10 members of the first group on the page.
2. To see more members, use the Show entries drop-down box to adjust the number of entries displayed.
3. In cases where there are potentially many members, search for specific members using the Search text box. Type an exact value for any of the columns in the table, or use the * wildcard for a partial value search. The search operates

on any of the columns in the preview table.

For example, the search in the following figure ( PowerEdge* ) finds the members of the All Hypervisors group that match a device model starting with PowerEdge.

<!-- image -->

The wildcard can appear anywhere in the search phrase. For example, the search in the following figure ( *lss* ) finds all entries with the character sequence of lss anywhere in a value.

<!-- image -->

4. To preview another group, click to select the wanted group name.

## Create a group

The Create action creates a property value and specifies the match rules for when that value is tagged to collected data.

## About this task

Following is a general procedure for creating a group. Some group types, because of their intended purpose, have logical restrictions on the membership rules. For these and other limitations, see the individual group descriptions.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Groups &gt; group\_type .
2. In a hierarchical group type, click the parent under which you want the new group to appear.
3. NOTE: This step does not apply to flat groups.
3. Click Create .
4. In the first text field, type the new group property value. For example, to create a Customer value, type the Customer name. It is the value that is added to tagged records.
5. If additional text boxes are displayed for additional properties, type those values.

For example, the service level groups display the Cost per GB field.

6. For flat or hierarchical groups, add dynamic rules to define the records that are tagged with the new property values.
2. NOTE: For flat groups, dynamic rules are the only way to add members. For hierarchical groups, the UI shows tabs for Dynamic Members and Static Members . Click Dynamic Members .

A dynamic member definition consists of one rule or multiple rules ANDed together to create a rule set. You can , or multiple rules sets to create a detailed filter.

The following steps provide guidelines for creating dynamic rules.

- a. From the drop-down list, choose Select a property .

<!-- image -->

Then do either of the following:

- Select one of the suggested property descriptions. The actual property name is automatically provided in the next text box. For example, if you select Device type , the property name devtype appears in the text box.
- Select Advanced , and then provide a database property name in the next text box.
- b. In the second drop-down list, select an operation. To use wildcards in the value, select Wildcard .

<!-- image -->

- c. In the last text box, provide the property value.

To see suggested values that are based on the property that is named in the first text box, click the box. The suggestions are obtained from existing discovered values in the infrastructure.

<!-- image -->

- d. To AND another rule, click Add Rule inside the ruleset box.
- e. To OR another ruleset, click Add new ruleset outside of the existing ruleset box.
- f. To verify defined membership, click Show Members .
7. For hierarchical groups, optionally add static members.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Static members are ones that you select from a list and manually add to the membership.

NOTE:

Static and dynamic members are combined to create the total membership for a group.

- a. Click the Static Members tab.
- b. To populate the preview table, make selections from the Type or Source Group drop-down lists. It creates a subset of items to choose from.

<!-- image -->

- c. To add a static member to the group, select a row in the preview table and click Add to group . The selection moves to the static member list.

8. Click Save .

<!-- image -->

## Edit a group

To change the membership rules for the group or change the new property values that are associated with the group, edit a group.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Groups &gt; group\_type .
2. In the right pane, select the group to edit by clicking it.
3. Click Edit .
4. Change the property values in the text boxes at the top of the page, if needed.
5. Change or add to the membership rules, as needed.
6. Click Save .

## Results

If you change a group name, all new tagging after the change uses the new group name. Regarding existing records in the database:

- The old group name is overridden by the new group name, if you change only the group name, the change is applied the next time the PTF process runs.
- You see both the old and new names in reports for a while, if you change both the group name and the rule definition, until the old group name ages out of the reports.

## View and reorder rules

For flat group types, the order of the group names affects the order that the rules are processed and the tagging outcome. You can review all rules for all groups, and reorder the groups to change the processing order of the rules.

## About this task

The Reorder and View All Rules buttons only appear on the dialogs for flat groups.

The new properties in flat groups can contain only one value. The first group name whose rules match the collected data is assigned. Ensure to order the groups so the most restrictive groups are first.

For example, in the list of service level groups, System Resource and Pool Contributor identify specialized storage uses. After that, Platinum rules are most restrictive. At the bottom of the list, Other is general and acts as the catchall group when no other rules match.

<!-- image -->

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Groups &gt; group\_type .
2. This procedure is relevant to flat groups only.
2. To view all rules for all groups, click View All Rules .
3. To exit the list of rules, click OK .
4. To reorder the rules, click Reorder .
5. Click the group whose placement you want to change.
6. Use the arrows to change that group's place in the list.

Ensure that the more restrictive groups appear before the less restrictive groups.

<!-- image -->

## 7. Click Save .

## Create a group by copying an existing group

In hierarchical group types, you can quickly create a group with almost the same rules as an existing group by copying and pasting the existing group.

## About this task

The Copy and Paste buttons are only available on the dialogs for hierarchical group types.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Chargeback &amp; Service Levels &gt; Block Chargeback Grouping &gt; group\_type .
2. Click to select the existing group that you want to copy, and then click Copy .
3. Click to select the group in the hierarchy that is the parent of the new group, and then click Paste . The new group appears under the selected group. It has the same name as the copied group.
4. Click to select the new group, and then click Edit .
5. On the Edit dialog box, change the group name and alter or add to the rules and static member selections, as needed.
6. Click Save .

## Get group membership rules as regex expression

You can see the complete membership rules for a group as a single regex expression.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Chargeback &amp; Service Levels &gt; Block Chargeback Grouping &gt; group\_type .
2. Click to select the group name whose membership rules you want to see.
3. Click Edit .
4. Click Click to show query at the bottom of the Edit page.

## Manage groups by exporting and importing files

As an alternative to creating and editing group names in the UI, developers or administrators can manage groups by exporting and importing files.

## About this task

The Groups Management UI creates and maintains the underlying configuration files that support the group definitions. You can export and save those files to a location outside of Dell SRM for backup purposes or to view and edit the settings. You can import an edited version into Dell SRM.

<!-- image -->

NOTE: Editing files offline and importing them is an advanced activity. End users are recommended to edit group settings using the Edit and Create buttons on the Groups Management UI.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Groups &gt; group\_type .
2. On the group type page, click Export and follow the browser's prompts to save the Zip file.
3. Extract the files with an extract utility. Two files are supported by each group type:

## XML configuration file

The .XML file defines the Property Tagging Filter (PTF) configuration for the group type. It includes:

- The &lt;files&gt; element defines the name of the associated data input file (the .CSV file), and the characters used in the file for delimiters and wildcards.

## CSV data input file

4. To import files:
- a. Ensure that you have preserved an exported version of the existing settings.

NOTE: This step is important. You are about to overwrite the existing settings.

- b. Archive the edited .CSV file and the .XML file into a Zip file. Both are required.
- c. Click Import , and choose the Zip file to upload.
- d. Click OK .

## Configuring server settings for online updates

You can configure the server to get the latest online updates from the server.

## Steps

1. Click Administration .
2. Go to CONFIG &gt; Update System &gt; Manage Online Update .
3. Ensure that you are on the Settings tab.
4. Check the Enabled checkbox.
5. Type the Dell Online Support username and password.
6. To test connectivity to the update server, click the icon.

The icon indicates that connectivity to the server failed.

7. Click Save .

## Enabling the online update task

Enable the Online Update task to download the latest updates from the Dell Update server automatically.

## Steps

1. Click Administration &gt; Home .
2. On the Physical Overview page, click &lt;host\_name&gt; -Front End where the Online Update task has to run.
3. Click Tasks .
4. Type OnlineUpdate in the Search bar.
5. Click the OnlineUpdate to run the scheduled task.
6. Click Enable .

NOTE: By default, this task is set to run once everyday at 12AM. You can customize the task schedule by editing the configuration file.

- The &lt;key-properties&gt; element defines the structure of the rules that are used to match existing data in the database.
- The &lt;new-properties&gt; element defines the names of the new properties to add when a match occurs.

Typically, you do not change this file. Use it to interpret the format of the .CSV file.

The .CSV file contains the group names and definitions in the acceptable format as required by the PTF. Each line represents a group name, with all the rules that define members of that group and the new property values for that group.

For example, for the Service Level by LUNs group type, each line contains the defining rules for membership in a group, and, at the end of each line, the chargeback cost basis, the minimum and maximum response rates, and the service level name.

## Troubleshooting

This section provides SolutionPack troubleshooting tips that can be used to resolve common SolutionPack issues.

- What to do if data does not appear in any reports
- What to do if data does not appear in some reports
- Viewing collector errors in the Collector-Manager log files

## What to do if data does not appear in any reports

Troubleshooting steps if data does not appear in any reports.

## Steps

1. After the completion of at least three collection cycles, verify if data is populating into the reports. If there is still no data in the reports, continue to the next step.
2. To import data into reports, run the scheduled task. If there is still no data in the reports, continue to the next step.
3. To view the log files for errors, browse to System Admin &gt; Logs &amp; Diagnostics &gt; Log Files &gt; Collector-

Manager::&lt;instance name&gt; .

## What to do if data does not appear in some reports

Troubleshooting steps if data does not appear in some reports.

## Steps

1. Run the scheduled task to import data into reports. If there is still no data in the reports, continue to step 2.
2. Search for the metric in the database.
3. To view the log files for errors, System Admin &gt; Logs &amp; Diagnostics &gt; Log Files &gt; Event-Processing\_Manager::Instance name .

To troubleshoot the errors, enable the Event-Spy for the Event Processing Manager.

## Viewing collector errors in the Collector-Manager log files

Review the Collector-Manager log files to troubleshoot problems with data collection.

## Steps

1. To view the log files for errors, Admin &gt; System Admin &gt; Log Files .
2. Expand Collecting .
3. Click the Collector-Manager for the collector instance.

Collector-Manager:&lt;Collector-Manager instance&gt; - &lt;host\_ID&gt;

## Data enrichment

The Data Enrichment page enables you to quickly add tagging to data coming from a collector-manager or an event-processing manager. To access the data enrichment page, select the data enrichment root node from the tree or select the data enrichment node that is located under the physical node.

The collector manager and/or the event-processing manager must be running to tag data and there must be at least one property tagging filter (for the collector manager) and one event property tagger (for the event processing manager).

The tagging status provides an indication of how the module is running:

- Running - the module is running.
- Module is not running - the module is not running.
- Server not reachable - the target server might be down.
- WS not Supported - the module is running but cannot get a response from the webservice. The module might be too old and does not support the web service.
- Unknown - any other errors.

To add a new property tagging filter or a new event property tagger to the list of tagging, click Register a new module and select a server, category, and the modules to register.

The Data Enrichment page cannot be used to modify property tagging filters or event property tagger configurations that contain an accessor.

Values that are not correctly written in the property tagging filter or event property tagger datafile appear in red italics. You cannot edit that value, but you can delete the row.

## Using the Data Enrichment UI

Use the data enrichment GUI to create the properties and define the rules for tagging data with the property values.

Here is the sequence of tasks that are required to add a property, populate it, verify it, and make it visible in a report.

1. Register a Collector Manager
2. Create new tagging structure
3. Populate the tag set rows
4. (Optional) Run the import property task and restart Collectors
5. Verify the new property

## 6. Add the new property to a report

## Register a Collector Manager

To enable a PTF to run, you must associate it, or register it, to a Collector Manager.

## About this task

To associate a data enrichment PTF to a Collector Manager, you register the Collector Manager.

Typically, a collector server hosts many Collector Managers. Typically, you want all collectors to use the same PTF to consistently tag data and populate the new properties. A best practice is to register a single module, the CollectorManager :: Load-Balancer :: DataEnrichment module, to minimize overhead and ensure that the same set of tagging rules is used on all data that are processed on a collector server.

If there is a reason to use different sets of rules for different Collector Managers, you can register each Collector Manager separately, and associate different tagging rulesets to each one.

## Steps

1. Log in to the Console and go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags .
2. Click the Manage Data Enrichment tab.
3. In the right pane, click Register a new module .
4. In the Servers column, select the server that hosts the data collecting module that you want to register. Typically, select the Collector server. However, other server types also host a few collecting modules.
5. In the Categories column, select Collecting .
6. In the Modules column, select one or more modules that you want to participate in the property tagging. For typical applications, choose Collector-Manager :: Load-Balancer :: DataEnrichment

.

<!-- image -->

- NOTE: The list shows only running modules. If the wanted module is not in the list, exit and check the status of the Collector Manager under Administration &gt; Home &gt; Physical Overview &gt; server\_name &gt; collector\_manager\_name . Use the Start or Restart buttons on the page if needed.
7. Click Register .

The Data Enrichment page redisplays, and the newly registered module appears in the table. You can now associate property tagging rules to the module.

<!-- image -->

## Create new tagging structure

To match against and the new properties to add, define the new tagging structure by defining the keys.

## Steps

1. Log in to the Console and go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags .
2. Click the Manage Data Enrichment tab.
3. Click a row for a registered module.

The tagging page appears.

This page contains a blue bar for each defined tag set.

NOTE: Dell SRM is installed with a predefined tag set named global-enrichment .

4. (Optional) Click the global-enrichment entry to expand it.

Examine the structure of this predefined tagging structure as a preview to the next few steps. Notice the following:

- This tagging structure contains one key, device .
- It contains four possible properties to add to records when a collected device value matches a rule.
- To populate the tagging structure, you would create rows in the table that specify the collected device values to match and the resulting four property values to add.
- The bunit , customer, and location properties can also be managed using the Groups Management interface.
5. To go with defining a new ruleset structure, click New tagging . A new blue bar appears, with input fields for defining the new tag set.
6. For Name , create a unique name for the new tag set.
- This name becomes the name of the CSV input file containing the rules that you define in the tag set.
7. To define a key for the structure, click Add new key and complete the details in the dialog box.
- a. For New column , start typing the APG database field name that you want to match on, and select the field from the list.
- b. For after , select the position of this new key in the key set. (For the first key, the position must be first .)
- c. For Default value , optionally type a default value for this field.

Type field in the next step specifies the value format. Default value is used as follows:

- A first record is created that uses all the default values.
- If you add a key into an existing structure that was already populated with records, the default value is used in all the existing records.
- d. For Type , select the type of match value to use for this field when populating the ruleset.

The following table provides guidelines for choosing an appropriate type. See Type attribute for PTF keys for descriptions and syntax of acceptable match values for each Type .

## Table 28. Type Description

| Type        | Description                                                              | Notes                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Range       | The match value must be a number range.                                  | Used only for number range matches. Syntax examples for match values are: â [1:10] to match 1 through 10 inclusive â [0:100] to match 0 through 99.99999            |
| String      | The match value must be an unquoted, exact-match, case-sensitive string. | String matches have good performance, supporting long files (>100,000 lines) with minimal impact.                                                                   |
| Regex       | The match value must be a Java normal expression.                        | Try to avoid using this type. Although a regex match is powerful, it is CPU-intensive. Dell Technologies recommends using one of the SQL wildcards matches instead. |
| Wildcard    | The match value must be a SQL pattern. Case-insensitive.                 | Wildcard and Wildcard-CI are the same. (Both perform case-insensitive SQL pattern matching.) Wildcards are:                                                         |
| Wildcard-CS | The match value must be a SQL pattern. Case-sensitive.                   | Wildcard and Wildcard-CI are the same. (Both perform case-insensitive SQL pattern matching.) Wildcards are:                                                         |

<!-- image -->

- e. For Delete after use , indicate whether to delete the matched property from the collected data after tagging is complete.

WARNING: Use this option with extreme caution. Deleting the fields can break the data model. Usually leave cleared.

The Delete after use option is useful if the intention is to replace a collected property and value with a new property and value.

- f. Click Save .
8. To add additional keys to the structure repeat the previous step.
9. To define a new property, click Add new property and complete the details in the dialog box.
- a. For New column , type a name for the new database property.
5. NOTE: APG database property names are limited to eight characters. If you use more than 8, the property name is truncated to 8.

<!-- image -->

NOTE: If you reuse a name that exists in the APG database, the rules populate the existing property. Dell Technologies recommends creating a property.

- b. For after , select the position of this new property in this tag set. (For the first property, the position is always first .)
- c. For Default value , optionally type a default value for this field.

It is used as follows:

- A first record is created that uses all the default values.
- If you add a property into an existing structure that was already populated with records, the default value is used in all the existing records.
- d. Click Save .
10. To add additional properties to the tag set structure repeat the previous step.
11. After creating all keys and all properties, click Save All .
12. On the Save Data Enrichment dialog box, select the modules that should use this tagging structure.

Select all that apply if you have multiple registered modules.

## 13. Click Update .

The tagging page reappears with a new blue bar for the new tag set.

## Type attribute for PTF keys

PTF keys are defined using a Type attribute. The Type defines the format of the match values.

## View the defined Type for a key

You can view the Type that was defined for a key by hovering the cursor over the column header until a tooltip appears for that column. The following image shows that the vendor key was defined with a Type of string. It means that the values you provide in that column must be strings, and cannot include wildcards.

<!-- image -->

## Type attribute values

The following list defines each Type value.

## String

Wildcards

## Range

## Regex

## @ values

The following special values are available for keys:

An unquoted string, where the string must match exactly.

Wildcard characters are accepted in a match value. There are multiple types that use wildcards:

- Wildcard -Case insensitive. Same as Wildcard-CI .
- Wildcard-CS -Case sensitive. For example, Z does not match z .
- Wildcard-CI -Case insensitive. For example, Z matches Z or z .

The following values are supported in the match values for keys with wildcard types:

- %or* -Any multiple characters
- \_or?-Any one character
- \-Escape character if needed

A range of numeric values is accepted as the match value. Decimal values are permitted. The following rules apply:

- Specify the beginning and ending integer or decimal values
- Separate the two values with a semi-colon
- Enclose the phrase with brackets, as follows:
- [ ] enclosing brackets indicate inclusive
- ] [ non-enclosing brackets indicate exclusive

combinations are permitted

Range value examples:

- [5:20] -Matches any value 5 through 20, including 5 and 20.
- [5:21]-Matches any value greater than 5 and less than 21.
- [5:20]-Matches any value 5 up to but less than 20. 19.5 would match.
- [0.5:1]-Matches any value 0.5 to 1, inclusive.

Any Java normal expression is supported as the match value.

- @DEFAULT -"**" -Matches all values.
- @EMPTY -"" (no space) -Matches a property that exists but is empty.
- @NULL -"@@" -Matches when the property does not exist.
- @MATCHALL -"%%" -Always matches, including when the property does not exist.

## Populate the tag set rows

To match and to add new property values populate the tag set with the key values.

## About this task

There are several ways to populate the rows:

- Add rows manually using the Console interface. This method creates a .CSV file using the name of the tagging set.
- Import a CSV or .XSL file.
- NOTE: Importing a file overwrites all entries currently in the table.
- Add a few rows using the Console, and then download the file, edit it to add more rows, and upload it.
- Add a few rows using the Console, and then open the file in the Console, edit it, and save it.

Key values must match the Type attribute that was configured for the key or use one of the special @ values.

## Steps

1. Log in to the Console and go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags .
2. Click the Manage Data Enrichment tab.
3. Click a registered module that is associated with the tagging set that you want to populate. A blue bar appears for each tagging set.
4. Click to expand the tagging set that you want to populate.
5. To type the first row:
- a. Click the first key field and type, or select a match value.

The value for a key field must be either:

- A value that conforms to the key's Type attribute (Range, String, Regex, or Wildcard).
- One of the @ value selections.

To view the Type attribute for a key, hover the cursor over the column heading until the tooltip appears.

<!-- image -->

In the example above, a valid wildcard match value is lgl* to match all device names that start with LGL or lgl.

- b. Click each key field, and provide a match value.
- c. Click each property (result) field, and provide the wanted value for the new properties.
- d. To commit a row press Enter .
6. To type subsequent rows, right-click the list icon at the beginning of a row, and select either Insert before or Insert after to place the new row in the wanted spot.

<!-- image -->

Rows are processed in the order in which they appear in this table (or the file). Row order can affect results, especially when you are using wildcards, normal expressions, or ranges. A subsequent row can overwrite a match by a previous row. Typically, you would start with the most general rule, such as a match on @DEFAULT or @MATCHALL, and end with more specific rules.

7. Click Save

.

This command saves the table contents to a file. The file name is the tag set name with an extension of .csv .

8. On the Save Data Enrichment dialog box, select all the registered modules that the file applies to, and click Update . The file is saved on each registered server, under Collecting/Property-Tagging-Filter/ module-name /conf/ tagset\_name .
9. To export a tag set file, click Export CSV or Export XSL .
10. To import tagging set values from an external file:

NOTE: Importing a file overwrites all entries currently in the table.

- a. Click Import CSV or Import XSL .
- b. Follow the browser prompts to import the file.
- c. Click Save after importing the file.
- d. Select all the registered modules that the file applies to, and then click Update .
11. To automate the data enrichment:
- a. Click Schedule PTF .
- b. Enter the required details and click Submit .
- c. Click Continue after getting connection successful message.
9. NOTE: To schedule the automation task or manually run the task: Go to CONFIG &gt; Settings &gt; Scheduled Tasks &gt; Data Enrichment .

## View and edit the PTF input file

After creating a few rows using the Console interface, you can view the file to determine the required format, and then manually add additional rows or import a file in the proper format.

## About this task

There are two ways to view and edit a saved PTF input file.

- Export the file, edit it in a text editor, and then import it.

NOTE: Importing a file overwrites all entries currently in the table.

- Open the file in the Console's text editor.

Either way, you notice that the @ values and wildcards that are used in the Console entry are translated into standardized wildcard values.

## Steps

1. To export and import a PTF input file:
- a. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Groups &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Data Enrichment .
- b. Click a registered module that you associated to the tag set.
- c. Expand the tag set name.
- d. Click Export or Import .
2. To open the file on the Console:
- a. Go to Administration &gt; Home &gt; Physical Overview &gt; registered-server-name &gt; Modules &gt; Collecting &gt; Property-Tagging-Filter :: registered-module-name .

The registered-server-name is typically a Collector server. The registered-module-name is typically LoadBalancer .

- b. In the right pane, expand Configuration Files .
- c. Locate the conf/ tag-set-name.csv file.
- d. Click Edit (pencil icon) next to the file.

The file opens in the Console file editor.

3. Add additional rows using the format of the existing file.

For example, here is the conf/email-contacts.csv file.

<!-- image -->

Notice that @DEFAULT values that are entered on the Console were translated into "**" . If you add rows, use the "**" notation, not the @DEFAULT notation.

4. After editing or importing an edited input file, apply the updates to all registered modules that use the tag set.
2. NOTE: If there is only one registered module that uses the tag set, this step is not needed.
- a. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Groups &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Data Enrichment .
- b. Select all modules that use the tag set associated with the edited file.
- c. Click Update .

## Edit a ruleset

You can change the structure of the ruleset by adding or deleting keys and properties. You can edit the values in the rows,

## Steps

1. Log in to the Console and go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Groups &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Data Enrichment .
2. Click a registered module that is associated with the tagging ruleset that you want to edit. A blue bar appears for each tagging ruleset.
3. Click to expand the tagging ruleset you want to populate.
4. To delete a key or a property from the structure, click Delete (trashcan icon) in the column header.

This action removes the column and all values.

5. To add a row, right-click the list icon in a row and select Insert Before or Insert After . For entry instructions, see Populate the tag set rows.
6. To delete a row, right-click the list icon in the row and select Delete .
7. To edit a value in a row, click the value, provide a new value, and press Enter to commit the changes.
8. To save the table, click Save , and then Update to apply the changes to selected registered modules.

## (Optional) Run the import property task and restart Collectors

Data enrichment processing depends on the configured intervals for the database property import task and the Collectors. For quicker data enrichment results, you can run them manually.

## About this task

It might take a day for all involved processes to run. The appearance of new properties depends on the following:

- The database import-properties task must run. This task updates the in-memory database cache on the Frontend.
- The collecting process must run the Property-Tagging-Filters. For accurate tagging results, sometimes two collection cycles are required.

If needed, you can run these processes manually.

## Steps

1. To run the database property import task manually:
- a. Click Administration &gt; Home &gt; Physical Overview &gt; server\_name - Front End &gt; Tasks &gt; Database &gt; importproperties-Default .
- b. In the right pane, click Run Now .

2. To restart a Collector-Manager:
- a. Click Administration &gt; Home &gt; Physical Overview &gt; collector\_server\_name .
- b. With the wanted collector server selected, click the Services tab.
- c. Select a Collector-Manager, and click Restart .

A Collector-Manager calls all the individual collecting components in its configuration, such as the stream and XML collectors and the PTFs.

## Verify the new property

After the new property has propagated through the system and the new PTF tag set is applied to collected data, you can see the property using Frontend tools.

## Steps

1. In the User interface, click Modifications &gt; Advanced Search .
2. In the Expansion field, click the icon for the Property selection helper .
3. To locate the new property, click the APG tab, and then use the search field at the bottom of the dialog box.

When searching, remember that a long property name was truncated to the first eight characters.

If the new property does not appear in the list, wait an hour and try again.

4. If the new property appears in the list, select it and exit the property selection helper.

The new property name should appear in the Expansion field. Delete any other property names.

5. Click Apply .

The search result lists the values for the property that have so far been applied to records in the database. It can take up to a day for all collectors to run, depending on settings at the site.

## Add the new property to a report

To make the new property visible, add it to a report.

## About this task

If you choose a report that includes the keys on which the tagging was based, you do not must redefine the report filter. The following example adds a column to a table report, assuming that the existing filter captures records that include the new property.

## Steps

1. Browse to the table report, and click Modifications &gt; Edit Reports .
2. Click the Report Details: Table tab.
3. Click + Property .
4. Scroll to the end of the property list (blue bars) and expand the Property: * bar.
5. Configure the new column:
- a. For Column Name , type the column header.
- b. If the user hovers the cursor over this column header for Description , type the description that appears in the tooltip.
- c. For Property , type the new property name.
- d. Click Save .
6. To return to the report click BROWSE MODE .

## Enabling impact analysis

Enable Impact Analysis to receive alerts that provide details about the effects of an event and to populate impact details on reports.

## Prerequisites

Impact Analysis uses the event change listener in the SolutionPack for Configuration Compliance. The SolutionPack for Configuration Compliance must be installed and configured before you can enable Impact Analysis.

## About this task

Impact Analysis gives users additional information about effects of an event in the SAN Environment. For example, if a switch port goes down many paths from host to LUN can be affected and become unavailable. Impact Analysis displays alerts for these paths. Similarly, if a disk fails or faults, the user receives alerts for all LUNs that are carved from the disk.

## Steps

1. Browse to Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; SolutionPacks &gt; Installed SolutionPacks .
2. Under Other Components , click the pencil icon for Alert Consolidation .

The Reconfiguring Window appears.

3. Click the Enable Impact Analysis checkbox.

To disable Impact Analysis, clear the checkbox.

4. Type the hostname or IP address of the host of the compliance change event listener. This host is typically the Compliance Backend host.
5. Type the change event listener port number, typically 2060.
6. Click Reconfigure.

If the operation succeeds, an OK button is enabled.

7. Click OK.

## Alerting Module

The Alerting module provides access to alerting administration and development features that are performed using the Web Portal.

This information is general to the Dell SRM core. For more information about alerting, see:

- Product documentation-Alerting implementations are product-specific. The product documentation provides relevant alerting implementation details. See Dell Support Site for links to product documentation.
- Backend documentation-The Alerting features are flexible and offer many opportunities for customization. For information about the alerting infrastructure and supporting configuration files, see the Dell M&amp;R Advanced Administration Guide , available on Dell Support Site.

## Alerting reports

Users access the alerting reports on the User Interface, in Browse mode.

## Change the refresh rate on alerting reports

Alerting reports are installed with preconfigured automatic refresh interval set to 180 seconds. You can change that value. To disable automatic refresh, change the setting to 0.

## About this task

At installations with a few alerts, you can reduce the refresh interval to as low as 15 seconds.

For larger events databases (with a total number of active alerts more than a few thousand), it may take a while for the alerting reports to load. Besides if those reports have the automatic refresh interval set too low, the alerting reports become unusable. You can increase the refresh interval or disable automatic refresh.

If automatic refresh is disabled, you can refresh manually with the refresh feature of browser to update the report as needed.

- NOTE: New alerts that originate from SNMP can take up to 4 minutes to appear in the alerting reports. This delay is independent of the refresh interval setting.

## Steps

1. Go to the report whose refresh rate you want to change, and then click Modifications &gt; Edit Reports .
2. Click the Report Details: Table tab.
3. Scroll to the bottom, and expand Display Options .
4. Set the Table refresh behavior option as set interval .
5. Change the value in Refresh interval (secs) .

To disable automatic refresh, type 0.

6. Click Save .
7. To return to the report display, click BROWSE MODE .

## Alerting infrastructure

The alerting module consists of various components that are installed on the Alerting Frontend and the Alerting Backend and a separate database only for alerts.

## Alerting Frontend

In most installations, the Alerting Frontend is the Primary Frontend. The components on the Alerting Frontend are the userfacing components:

- Alerting reports show information from the database.
- Alert Definitions define all the conditions that cause events to be written to the database. Alert definitions also define other actions that can occur, such as an email notification, an entry to a log file, or a trap to a third-party application.
- Alert Templates are useful for consistency in creating alert definitions.
- Alert Adapters and Grouped Boxes customize the alerting module and are mostly for developer use.

## Alerting Backend

In most installations, the Alerting Backend is the Primary Backend. The components on the Alerting Backend include all the supporting processes for consolidating events from various sources into a single format and for writing the consolidated alerts to the Events database.

## Alerting (Events) database

The Events database contains two tables.

genericevents\_live table

This table stores all ACTIVE alerts. The All Alerts report on the Console, and all the reports that are filtered versions of it, are based on the entries in this table.

An ACTIVE alert is one whose Active property has the value 1 .

genericevents\_archi ve table

This table stores INACTIVE alerts until they are purged from the system.

An INACTIVE alert is one whose Active property has the value 0 .

## Access the alerting portal page

The alerting page lets you create, edit, enable, and disable alert definitions. It also accesses the templates, adapters, and grouped boxes nodes.

## About this task

The URL to the Alerting page is &lt; Tomcat server address &gt;/alerting-frontend . For example:

http://localhost:58080/alerting-frontend

From the user interface, use these instructions:

## Steps

1. If you are in the reporting interface, click Administration .
2. Click Config &gt; Alerts .

## Alerting node tools

The tools above the alerting node tree manage the node hierarchy.

The tools can be unavailable depending on the node you select.

| Deletes the element.                                                                                                                                       |

## Alert definitions

An alert definition defines the actions that should occur when an event meets defined conditions.

For an event to result in an action, such as an email notification or getting added to the database, it must match a valid and ENABLED alert definition.

SolutionPacks install predefined alert definitions appropriate to their function and devices. You can create custom alert definitions.

An alert definition contains the following components:

- An entry point filter defines which events are handled by this alert definition. The filter operates on the fields (properties) in the event data. The filter identifies events by matching values in data fields, such as a MIB name and field, or a collector name and metric, or an event name and device type.
- Operations and conditions are optional components in an alert definition. Operations provide a way to change the metric data in an event. Conditions test the data and provide alternate outcomes for different actions.
- Actions define what should occur as a result of the event, such as an email, logging file entry, sending HTTP/HTTPS request, SNMP trap to an Events database, or traps to other applications. Only events that are written to the Events database appear in the alerting reports.

## Access alert definitions

You can configure and enable or disable alert definitions. You can also view a graphical representation of the alert definition, modify it (such as add or remove actions or change the filter), and add new alert definitions.

## Steps

1. Click Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Alerts &gt; Manage Alert Definitions
2. Expand the alert definition folders until the alert definition name appears. In the right pane, the Type column indicates whether the entries are folders or alert definition names.
3. In the table in the right pane, right-click an alert definition, and choose one of the following actions.
4. NOTE: If you click (as opposed to right-click) an alert definition, the UI invokes either the Edit or Configure action, depending on the last choice you made using the right-click menu.
4. To set the default action ( Configure or Edit ) for the current session when you click an alert definition, select the required option one time on the right-click menu.

## About configuring alert definitions

An alert definition defines the actions that should occur when an event meets defined conditions. The conditions are sometimes configurable.

The Alerting Frontend interface presents the configurable parts of an alert definition as fields that you can easily configure. For example, here is the form for configuring utilization thresholds for an alert that is related to switch ports.

An alert definition must be ENABLED for the specified actions to occur.

## Components in an alert definition

An alert definition contains at least one entry point filter and one action. It can contain multiple entry points and actions, and optional operations and conditions that change and evaluate data elements in the event data.

## Entry point

The entry point is the filter defining which events are to be handled by this alert definition. The filter operates on the fields (properties) in the event data.

NOTE: In the alerting process, the event data is normalized into a standard format, but the event is not yet in any database. Therefore, the filter wizard might not be able to prompt you with all valid values. To write a filter, you must research the source of the event and its normalization rules.

Here is an example entry point filter for the Backend Processing Delay alert definition in the System Health folder. The source for this alert is the metric that is called ProcessingDelay collected by the APG\_Health collector.

Figure 4. Filter in an alert definition

<!-- image -->

An alert filter typically includes a test for the source of the event. The following table shows some often used field names for filtering on event sources in Dell SRM.

Table 29. Field names for filtering on event sources

| Event type                              | Event source filter                                             | Example                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Metric-based thresholds from collectors | source==' collector_name '                                      | source=='APG_HEALTH'                                                                    |
| Events from the event listener          | source==' name_GenericEvent '                                   | Source=='VMAX- GenericEvent'                                                            |
| Events from SNMP traps                  | Source=' vendor_in_MIB %' & ( sourcedomainname== MIB_data_field | Source='Cisco%' & ( sourcedomainname=='c ieLinkDown' | sourcedomainname=='cie LinkUp' ) |
| Events from scheduled reports           | source==' report_name '                                         | reportName=='apg report'                                                                |

## Operations

Operations evaluate incoming data to see if they should go to the next component or be dropped. A large set of operations are available, including case, arithmetic, aggregation, time window, date, and so on.

Here is a Time Window operation that calculates an average.

Figure 5. Operator in an alert definition

<!-- image -->

## Conditions

Conditions let you set up multiple outcomes in the same alert definition. Each outcome is based on the results from a condition, and would typically have different actions that are associated with them. Two types of conditions are available.

- Comparators let you define value tests. A common technique in Dell SRM is a chain of comparators, each one using a different comparator value. The outcomes are a series of SNMP traps creating Critical, Major, Minor, and finally a Clear Trap, all on the same property, and in the same alert definition.
- Counters let you count occurrences within a specified time range.

Here is an example comparator that uses Log actions as outcomes. Since the Alert Trap action is missing, events that are processed by this alert definition do not make it into the Events database.

Figure 6. Comparator with two outcome paths

<!-- image -->

## Actions

The following actions are available:

- An SNMP Alert Trap or Clear Trap, which gets the event into the alerting database or subsequently clears it.
- A Log action, which writes the event to a log file.
- A Mail notification, which sends an email to preconfigured email addresses.
- A Webhook Action, which sends an HTTP/HTTPS POST request to the preconfigured URL. For more information about Webhook, see Dell SRM Alerting Guide.
- An SNMP trap to a third party, such as another management system.

## NOTE:

- Do not add the Dell Technologies Connectivity Event action to any alert definition. The Dell Technologies Connectivity Event action is for Dell use only.
- The Send to SAM action is for use by customers who have Dell Service Assurance Suite installed.

Here is a set of comparators, each one associated with two outcome paths. The Alert Trap contents in each action are similar. The difference would be the severity that is set in the trap contents.

## Example: Putting it all together

Here is an alert definition that contains two entry points to define two data fields, and then performs several operations to derive a new value. There are three conditional tests on that value, and the outcome actions are a series of Alert Traps with different severities and corresponding Clear Traps.

Figure 8. Example alert definition

This is the Percentage of File System Free Space Alert in the System Health folder, in case you want to explore how all the components are configured.

## Contextualized and non-contextualized alert definitions

Contextualized alert definitions allow for more than one set of configuration values. Different named contexts can be configured differently.

Contextualized alert definitions provide the following advantages:

- If future SolutionPack upgrades change the alert definition, the customized parameter settings are not affected because the contexts are saved separately from the alert definition.
- You can define several contexts, or sets of values, for the same parameter set, and enable or disable the contexts separately. For example, you might have different settings for production and testing, or you might preserve the installed values in the default context and create a context for the customized values.

When you configure a contextualized alert definition, you select the context that you are providing values for. You can create and name new contexts.

Non-contextualized alert definitions can have only one set of configuration values.

## Contextualizing an alert definition

You can add contextualization to components in an alert definition and set the values for the default context.

## About this task

This procedure describes how to add contextualization to a component in an alert definition This is a one-time process that sets up a component and parameter for contextualization. Thereafter, users can add additional contexts by right-clicking the alert definition and selecting Configure .

Many alert definition components, including all threshold Comparators, are contextualized out of the box. Administrators can use this procedure to contextualize the alert definition components that are not contextualized.

NOTE: The Action components, such as webHooks, traps, logging, and email notifications, do not need to be contextualized. Those configurations are not overwritten.

## Steps

1. Right-click the alert definition and choose Edit .
2. Double-click the component in the alert definition that you want to contextualize. A configuration dialog box appears for the component.

3. Click the small down-arrow next to the configurable element, such as a parameter or filter, and choose Define configuration .
4. Complete the fields:
- For Configuration item key label , type a name for this parameter that the user sees on the configuration window.
- For ordering, optionally select the order in which the parameters appear on the configuration window.
- For Configuration item key , type a key that is used to uniquely identify the context and reference the context in other contexts within the same alerting definition. For example, an alert definition might have 3 log actions for different conditions. By using a key, you can configure the log action component one time and then reference it in the other components by choosing Configuration Reference when you configure the second and third components.
- For the last field, type the default configuration that appears in the field when the user adds a context.
5. Click OK .
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for additional parameters in the component.
7. Click Save below the alert definition whiteboard.
8. As a best practice, add the first context. Otherwise, the component remains unconfigured.
- a. Return to the alert definition list, right-click the alert definition, and choose Configure .
- b. Click Add .
- c. Provide a name for the context. A best practice is to name the first context Default .
- d. Click Save .

## Results

The alert now appears in the alert definition list with an icon indicating that it is contextualized. Users can configure it to add additional contexts, and enable or disable the contexts.

## Configuring an alert definition

The Configure action lets you change the filter and configurable settings in an alert definition, add new contexts and configure them if appropriate, and test or probe the alert definition results.

## About this task

For example, alert definitions often compare values in an event to a configurable threshold setting. A filter defines which events to consider. If an alert definition is contextualized, you can you define different filters or threshold values and name them.

<!-- image -->

Not all alert definitions are contextualized.

## Steps

1. Click Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Alerts &gt; Manage Alert Definitions .
2. In the table of alert definitions, expand the folders to find the alert definition to configure.
3. Right-click the alert definition and choose Configure options .
- If the alert is contextualized, you see one or more named contexts, with the configurable parameter names and the values for each context. Out of the box, one context is named Default .
- If the alert is not contextualized, you see the configurable parameters and the current settings.
4. For a contextualized alert, you can:
- Change the values in any of the existing contexts, including the Default context or any other named context.
- Create a context, as follows:
- a. Click Add .
- b. Name the new context, and click OK .
- c. Type values in the new context.
- Choose Enable or Disable for each context. When multiple contexts are enabled, the incoming events are processed multiple times, once for each enabled context.
5. For a non-contextualized alert, change the values in one or more fields.
6. Click Save .

<!-- image -->

If the alert definition is enabled, the change takes effect immediately.

## Editing an alert definition

You can change or add additional components to an alert definition.

## About this task

By editing an alert definition, you can change the filter or add or delete the actions or operations in the alert definition.

- NOTE: Do not add the Dell Technologies Connectivity Event action to any alert definition. The Dell Technologies Connectivity Event action is for Dell use only.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Alerts &gt; Manage Alert Definitions .
2. Expand nodes until the alert definition you want to edit appears in the table in the right pane.
3. In the right pane, right-click the alert definition and choose Edit .

A graphical representation of the alert definition appears on a whiteboard, with an expanding list of available components on the right.

Figure 9. Graphical representation of an alert definition

<!-- image -->

4. To reconfigure an existing component:
- a. Hover the cursor over the component until a menu of small icons appears above the component, and click Edit (pencil icon).

For example, to refine the filter in the Filtered Entry, hover the cursor over the Filtered Entry component in the alert definition.

<!-- image -->

- b. Make changes to the component's configuration in the dialog box that appears.
- c. To preserve the changes and exit the dialog box, click OK .
5. To add component:
- a. In the list of components on the right, click the type of component you want to add.

The type expands to show all available components in that category. For example, click Action to show all the action components.

<!-- image -->

- b. Drag the symbol for the desired component from the list onto the whiteboard. For example, to add an email notification action, drag the Mail object.
- c. Complete the configuration dialog box that appears when you release the drag, and click OK .

To reconfigure the component later, hover the cursor over the symbol and click the Edit icon that appears.

- d. Add the new component into the alert definition flow by dragging a line between connection points on the symbols.
- Start the drag from an exit connection point.
- Drag to an entry connection point.

Exit connection points are on the right side of a symbol. Entry connection points are on the left.

The following example connects the "Condition not met" exit point of a Comparator to the Mail action. (The alert definition sends an email when the condition is not met.)

<!-- image -->

6. Click Save at the bottom of the whiteboard to save all changes to the alert definition.

## Enable/disable alert definitions

Many alert definitions are installed in the disabled state. If you want the events that are defined by their filters to generate alerts enable the alert definitions.

## About this task

You can enable or disable alert definitions at the folder level, subfolder level, or individually.

## Steps

1. Go to Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Manage Alert Definitions .
2. To enable or disable alert definitions:
- a. Click folder rows in the right pane until the folders or individual alert definitions that you want to enable or disable appear as a row in the table.
- b. Select one or more rows in the right pane using the check boxes in the first column.
- c. Click Enable or Disable at the bottom of the page.

If you selected a folder, all alert definitions under that folder are affected, including the contents of any sub-folders.

3. In the right pane, use the State column to determine the status of individual alert definitions.
2. NOTE: The state of an alert definition, if modified, is retained even after the system upgrade.

## Table 30. Alert Definition Status

| State column   | Description                                                                                                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Empty          | This state column is a folder. Click it to show its contents.                                                         |
|                | The alert definition is enabled.                                                                                      |
|                | The alert definition is disabled.                                                                                     |
|                | The alert definition requires some configuration before you can enable it. Right-click the row and choose Configure . |

## Creating alert definitions

You can use alert definition examples to help you get started with constructing alert definitions.

## Steps

1. From the Alerting page, click Alert definitions .
2. Click the Create Alert Definition icon above the tree. A whitespace opens with components that are listed on the right.
3. Drag an Entry Point component onto the whitespace and configure it. When you release the drag, a dialog box for configuring the component opens.

The Entry Point filter works like report filters do in the main user interface.

The difference between using a filter in the Alerting Frontend and the Backend is the suggestions that are shown in the wizard. The Alerting Backend is not bound to a database, so the list of known properties and values is created at runtime. So, it is normal to have no suggestions when you use the wizard immediately after starting the Alerting Backend.

4. In the component list on the right, expand the type of component you want to work with next.
5. Drag a component onto the whitespace and configure it. You can rearrange components later by dragging them.
6. Continue to drag components and configure them, ending with an Action component.
7. Connect components to define the processing flow for an entry that is captured by the entry point filter.

Every component has connectors, which are yellow squares. To link components, click an output connector on the right side of a component, and drag to an input connector on the left side of another component. When the input connector turns green, release the drag.

NOTE: To delete a connection, drag the line off the input connector point and release. The connecting line disappears.

There is no limit to the number of objects that you can link to the same output.

8. When you are finished adding components, click Save .
9. In Name , type a name for the alert definition.
10. In Description , type a description for the alert definition.

## 11. Click Save and enable or Save and disable .

NOTE: For a detailed list of metrics and reports, see 4.4 Metrics and Reports, and for a detailed list of properties definitions, see 4.4 Properties Definitions.

## About the Dell Technologies Connectivity alert definitions

Do not change or reconfigure the Dell Secure Remote Support (Dell Technologies Connectivity) alert definitions.

The System Health SolutionPack and SolutionPack for Configuration Compliance include the optional features that forward alerts about certain health conditions and breaches for end of support for data center devices to Dell. The features are installed and configured during System Health SolutionPack and SolutionPack for Configuration Compliance installation by the alerting block question.

<!-- image -->

- NOTE: Unless you configure the Dell Technologies Connectivity settings in the alerting block question, no information is sent to Dell.

A set of Dell Technologies Connectivity alert definitions is associated with this feature. Note the following:

- The Dell Technologies Connectivity alert definitions are hidden by default. To unhide the alert definitions, see the next section.
- Do not change or reconfigure the Dell Technologies Connectivity alert definitions.
- Do not add the Dell Technologies Connectivity Event action (used in the Dell Technologies Connectivity alert definitions) to other alert definitions.
- The alert definition Enable and Disable commands do not apply to the Dell Technologies Connectivity definitions. The Dell Technologies Connectivity definitions are always enabled when the System Health SolutionPack alerting block is installed, and always disabled otherwise.

## Unhide the Dell Technologies Connectivity alert definitions

You can optionally unhide the Dell Technologies Connectivity alert definitions to view them.

## Steps

1. On the SRM Admin UI page, go to Administration &gt; Profile &gt; User Settings &gt; Extras .
2. Enable the Display hidden definitions button.
3. Click SAVE CHANGES .

The Dell Technologies Connectivity alert definitions appear in the Alert definitions list.

NOTE: The alert definition is for viewing only. Do not change it.

## Alert definition component reference

An alert definition is a sequential set of components that filters events and takes appropriate action. There are four types of alert definition components.

| Entry point filter   | Defines the events and metrics to examine. Every alert definition requires an entry point filter.                                                                                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operations           | Define operational actions on the filtered event data. Operations are optional.                                                                                                                            |
| Conditions           | Define test conditions on the event data. Different actions can depend on conditional outcomes. Conditions are optional.                                                                                   |
| Actions              | Define the actions to take, such as creating an SNMP trap to forward to the alerting backend or write a log entry. At least one action component is required for the alert definition to have any results. |

## Entry Point filter

The Entry Point filter works like report filters in the main user interface.

The difference between using a filter in the Alerting Frontend and the Backend is the suggestions that are shown in the wizard. The Alerting Backend is not bound to a database, so the list of known properties and values is created at runtime. Because of this, it is normal to have no suggestions when you use the wizard immediately after starting the Alerting Backend.

## Operations

Operations evaluate incoming data to see if they should go to the next component or be dropped.

## No Operation

This operation does not do anything. Use it if an entry needs separate senders in its process when all the entries come from the same operation, such as a Previous Polling Operation. It is a good way to make a used connector (red) of a grouped box available as an output if needed.

## Case

This operation creates logical output groups that send data to each next operation until one has its condition met, such as a group of alert levels that send an alert only once for the highest level of alert. The order of criticality of the next components is the order of link creation, so the next component link is the highest level and if its condition is met when the next data is received, the other next components will not receive data.

## Constant Arithmetic

This operation applies an operator on each entry data with a constant value.

Value

Value that is used by the operator.

Operator

The arithmetic operator (+, -, / or *)

Constant is left operand

Select this if the constant value must be the left operand.

## Data Arithmetic

This operation applies an operator on two data lines that are defined by the filter.

| Operator     | The arithmetic operator (+, -, / or *)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Time limit   | Maximum delta between the two values in minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Left operand | Optional and needed only if you use an operator that produces a different result depending on the order of the operand, such as - and /. This parameter must contain the name of the sender who sends the data that must be the left side of the operation. |
| Group by     | Properties, each separated by a white space, that create a logical group of values for the operation.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Value filter | Optional and is necessary only if the entries of this operation come from the same input, as it defines two different elements of the same group.                                                                                                           |

## Constant Math

This operation applies a complex mathematical operation to the data.

| abs   | The abs function which returns the absolute number.                                         |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ceil  | The ceil function which returns the smallest value but greater than the argument.           |
| exp   | The exp function which returns the exponential value raised to the power of a double value. |

floor

The floor function which returns the largest value but less than the argument.

## Configurable Math

## Previous Polling Operation

This sliding window operation keeps a series of previous polling for each data ID and distributes it to the outputs.

Time range

Optional and is the time window of the collected values in minutes.

Window length

Number of previous polling to keep

## Data Repeater

This operation blocks or allows output for every data that have their timestamps outside the timeframe.

Update timestamps

Select this to have the timestamps of each repetition be the current timestamp; do not select this to have the actual timestamp used.

Repetitions

Repetition number for each ID. 0 = unlimited

Repeat period

Time in minutes between repetitions

## Date

This operation blocks or allows the output of data that does not have a timestamp within the timeframe.

Block if in range

Select this to block data if the timestamp is in the range you set here.

Start time

Start day

End day

Optional. select this if the time range can be repeated for successive days, such as 8:00 to 17:00 Monday to Friday.

## Properties To Values Creator

This operation takes a list of properties and creates a value for each property that contains a numeric value. The original data is not sent to the next components. Type a list with each property that is separated by a white space.

## Timestamp To Value Creator

This operation creates data with the data timestamp as its value. The original data is not sent to the next components.

## Alive Timer Operation

This operation sends the last received data to the next components only when no data for the same ID has been received before the timer expires.

Inform only once

Select this to send non-updated data to the next components only once rather than at the end of each period.

Timer

Period of the timer. This value cannot be lower than 5, as every 5 minutes a check is made to see if any ID is not updated.

## Conditions

A condition verifies a condition of the data before sending it to its actions or operations. Conditions can be stateful or stateless. In a stateless condition, new data is sent to the next component. A stateful condition sends the data only when the state is changed. For example, if state of ID A = true, data is sent only when the state is false.

## Constant Comparator Operation

Compares data with a constant value and adds the ADDED\_THRESHOLD property containing the comparator in the output data. Data that meets the conditions is sent to the true actions or operations. Data that does not meets the conditions is sent to the false actions or operations.

Must be a valid number to compare data with its value

Operator

Operator of the comparison (&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, = or !=)

## Data Comparator Operation

Compares two pieces of data coming from two entries and defined by a grouping filter. Each comparison ends with the piece of data on the left sent to the true actions or operations when the condition is met, or to the false actions or operations if the condition is not met.

Stateless

Select this to send the result for each piece of data received, or do not select this to send data if a state changes for an ID.

Operator

Operator of the comparison (&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, = or !=)

Left operand

Must contain the name of the sender who sends the data that must be the left side of the operation.

Time limit

Maximum delta between the two values in minutes

Group by

Properties that create a logical group of values for this operation

## String Comparator Operation

Compares one of the fields in the data with a custom string. Each piece of data with a condition met is sent to the true actions or operations, or to the false actions or operations if the condition is not met.

Stateless

Select this to send the result for each piece of data received, or do not select this to send data if a state changes for an ID.

Field name

Name of the field in the data to use in the comparison

Comparator

Type of comparison (equals, contains, starts with or ends with)

Select this to send the result for each piece of data received, or do not select this to send data if a state changes for an ID.

Time range

Time window boundary of the collected values in minutes

Count

Counter

## String Counter Operation

This conditional operation counts the times that data with the same ID has a property equal to a comparator, and sends them to their true actions or operations when the count reaches the counter in the time limit. To make a counter with more string operations, use a stateless String Comparator with a Sender Counter.

Stateless

Select this to send the result for each piece of data received, or do not select this to send data if a state changes for an ID.

Time range

Time window boundary of the collected values in minutes

Count

Counter

Field name

## Actions

Actions inform users of new or resolved problems in their system or run an auto resolving process.

## About action data

Each alert data comes with a series of properties. Since most of the time they are coming from the Watch4net collectors, they are the same properties that you find when editing a report. When the Alerting Backend is running, you can have a view of those properties either in an entry point filter or when probing an active definition.

For example, suppose you want to send an email reporting the current CPU utilization for a specific CPU in a device based on the alert data below:

```
AlertData: { VALUE: 25 TMST: 123456789 (unix timestamps) ID: uniqueId for this metric properties: { devtype: Array device: VPLEX1 parttype: CPU part: CPU0 name: CurrentUtilization } }
```

You would add the following as the content of the email message:

```
Device PROP.'device' currently has a PROP.'name' on its PROP.'part' of VALUE.
```

This would translate dynamically as:

```
Device VPLEX1 currently has a CurrentUtilization on its CPU0 of 25.
```

## Log action

This action writes an entry in a log file. If two actions write to the same file, use the same parameters except for the content, because the Alerting Backend cannot guarantee which configuration is used. The default directory for the log files is Backends/ Alerting-Backend/Default/logs.

## Table 31. Log action

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Dell Technologies Connectivity event action

- NOTE: Do not add the Dell Technologies Connectivity event action to any alert definitions.

The System Health SolutionPack includes an optional feature that forwards alerts about certain health conditions to Dell. The Dell Technologies Connectivity event action is for the exclusive use by Dell for the Dell Technologies Connectivity alert feature.

## Webhook action

This action sends an HTTP/HTTPS POST request to the URL configured in the webHook definition, every time the configured alert condition occurs.

## Creating adapters

An adapter takes data and translates it to alerting data.

## Creating a Values Socket Listener Adapter

This adapter waits for values from the socket connector in the collecting.xml file. The data has the properties adapterName containing the name of this adapter and adapterType containing RVSocketListener.

## Steps

1. From the Alerting page, click Adapters .
2. Click the New element icon above the tree.
3. From the Type list, select Values Socket Listener Adapter .
4. In Name , type a descriptive name for the adapter.
5. In Port , type the port that the adapter takes its incoming raw data from.

## Creating an Events Adapter

This adapter waits for events from a generic-event-writer in the processing.xml file. The data has the properties adapterName containing the name of this adapter and four parameters.

## Steps

1. From the Alerting page, click Adapters .
2. Click the New element icon above the tree.
3. From the Type list, select Events Adapter .
4. In Name , type a descriptive name for the adapter.
5. In Value , optionally type the name of the field containing the decimal value of the event to be used in the operation, such as bytes for flow events. You can leave this box blank for a strings only event.
6. In Properties , type a comma-separated list of the properties that are used in the entry point or special components. If the default data type of a property does not give the best display format, type the data type of the field with the field name separated by a comma, for example SRC\_PORT:INT. The data types can be Boolean, byte, bytes, double, float, int, long, numeric, short, object, or string. The data type is implementation-specific for the type of data the adapter is parsing.
7. In Timestamps , optionally type the field that contains the timestamps of the events. Otherwise, the current timestamps are used.
8. In Port , type the port that the adapter takes its incoming raw data from.

## Creating a report data adapter

This adapter parses exported reports. The properties of the data are the report displayed properties and the report name (property = reportName). Table reports contain the non value columns and the name of the value column (property = name). Graph reports have the legend of each series (property = name). Each file parsed is deleted after parsing. The resulting data has the properties adapterName containing the name of this adapter and adapterType containing APGXmlReportAdapter.

## Steps

1. From the Alerting page, click Adapters .
2. Click the New element icon above the tree.
3. From the Type list, select Report Data Adapter .
4. In Name , type a descriptive name for the adapter.
5. The Time check is the time between each check which is set by default to 60 minutes. You can change this default value to the required value.
6. In Directory , optionally type the subdirectory under the Alerting custom directory that contains the files to parse.
7. In File name regex , type the file name regex. You can use the * wildcard character.

| Option      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Entry Point | The Entry Point filter works like report filters on the APG Frontend. It filters the flow of incoming data for alert definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Operation   | Operations evaluate incoming data to see if they should go to the next element or be dropped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Condition   | A condition verifies a condition of the data before sending it to its actions or operations. Conditions can be stateful or stateless. In a stateless condition, new data is sent to the next component. A stateful condition sends the data only when the state is changed. For example, if state of ID A = true, it sends data only when the state is false. |
| Action      | Actions inform users of new or resolved problems in their system or run an auto resolving process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Using preconfigured alert templates and examples

Alert Manager comes with preconfigured templates and example alert definitions. You can edit the existing ones or create ones based on the templates and examples.

## About this task

There are several example alert definitions. Alert definition components can reference a template. Log and Traps are the most frequently used actions in alert definitions. We provide a log template and two trap templates.

## Steps

1. To view an example alert definition:
- a. From the Alerting page, click Alert definitions &gt; Examples .
- b. In the right pane, right-click an alert definition name and select Edit .
2. To view a preconfigured template:
- a. From the Alerting page, click Templates &gt; template\_name .
- b. Review and edit the template contents before associating it to alert definitions.
3. To edit the default trap templates to work in your environment:
- a. From the Alerting page, click Templates &gt; default trap template .
- b. In the Template Parameters section, examine the Trap Content field.

The preconfigured trap template lists all possible alert properties, including some properties that are user-defined. It is probable that your MIB does not contain fields for the entire list of properties. In that case, any SNMP trap action component that references the default alert trap template does not work.

- c. Replace any property in the list that does not exist in your MIB with the value null .

The order of properties is important in a template.

NOTE: To preserve the out-of-the-box template for future use, create a template with an edited list of properties.

<!-- image -->

Here is an example edited property list.

PROP.'id',PROP.'Name', null ,PROP.'count',PROP.'eventstate',PROP.'Source',PROP.'parttype ',PROP.'part',PROP.'eventname',PROP.'parttypedisplayname',PROP.'partdisplayname',PROP. 'eventdisplayname',PROP.'fullmsg',PROP.'devtype',PROP.'device',PROP.'sourceip',PROP.'s ourcedomainname',PROP.'sourceeventtype',PROP.'value',PROP.'active',PROP.'timestamp', nu ll,null,null,null,null ,PROP.'acknowledged',PROP.'eventtype',PROP.'category',PROP.'even ttext',PROP.'severity',PROP.'impact',PROP.'certainty',PROP.'inmaintenance',PROP.'troub leticketid',PROP.'owner',PROP.'systemdefined1', null,null,null,null ,PROP.'userdefined1' , null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null, null,null

- d. Click Save .
4. To associate a template to an SNMP trap action:
- a. Under Alert Definitions , click an alert definition folder.
- b. In the table in the right pane, right-click the alert definition name and select Edit . The diagram of components for this alert opens.
- c. Click the Edit (pencil) icon above the SNMP trap action component (a green circle).
- d. In the Edit Component dialog box that opens, in the Template field, select the appropriate template name from the drop-down list.

## Setting up a log template

This example shows creating a template based on the Log template. Logs are frequently used actions in alert definitions.

## Steps

1. From the Alerting page, expand Templates .
2. Click Log Template .
3. In Description , type a description for the new template.
4. In File prefix , type the directory path and prefix for each log file. The log files are created in the Alerting-Backend/instance/Alerts folder and named log\_INDEX.log, where index is

incremented until it reaches the log retention limit. The newest log files have the lowest index, and the current log is the 0 log.

5. In Logs retention , type the number for how many logs you want to keep.
6. In Rotation time , type a value for the maximum time in minutes that log data is gathered before the log is created. This value is optional if you are setting a value for rotation entries. In this example, the logs files are rotated once a day (1440

minutes).

7. In Rotation entries , type a value for the maximum number of entries per log file. This value is optional if you are setting a rotation time. In this example, the log is rotated when the 0 log file has 5000 entries.
8. In Entry content , type the properties for the log entry. To add the value, date or ID of the current data, use the keywords VALUE, TMST, or ID. To add a property of the current

data, use the keyword PROP.'propertyName'. In this example, each line of the log contains: DEVICE with PART -&gt; NAME = VALUE.

9. Click Save .

## Setting up a trap notify and trap clear template

This example shows how to create a template based on the Trap Notify template. Traps are frequently used actions in alert definitions. A Trap Notify alert sends an alert to your fault management system. The Trap Clear deactivates the alert.

## Steps

1. From the Alerting page, expand Templates .
2. Click Trap Notify Template .

3. In Description , type a description for the new template.
4. In Host , type the host that receives the traps.

The host is the address of the SNMP trap manager and should be changed if it is not on the same host as the alerting backend.

5. In Port , type the trap manager port.162 is the default for this protocol.
6. In Community , type the trap community. Public is the default.
7. In Generic ID , type the generic ID of the trap.
8. In Enterprise specific ID , type the specific ID of the trap format for the generic type.
9. In Trap content , type the content for each variable of the trap, which is separated by commas.

Commas are escaped if they are preceded by a \. To add the value, date or ID of the current data, use the keywords VALUE, TMST, or ID. To add a property of the current data, use the keyword PROP.'propertyName'. Dell Technologies recommends that you do not change the content of the traps as the order of the properties match our trap configuration. You can change the last three properties to ones you define. The only difference between Trap Notify and Trap Clear is the number value in the Trap content: 2 is notified and 4 is clear.

## Grouped boxes

Grouped boxes are containers of standard alerting components, which are linked in the same way as alert definitions, that you can use in an alert definition or other grouped boxes.

With grouped boxes that you can:

- Create a subset of boxes such as baseline computations that you can reuse in multiple definitions. Grouped Boxes can contain any alert definition component and can easily be reused.
- Create a single box that has its instances that are updated whenever it is modified, unlike templates that do not have a link. When you make a change to a grouped box, the change is immediately propagated to all the alert definitions that use it.

Unlike alert definitions, which are grouped boxes have free inputs and outputs on any number of components, whether they are linked or not. The free connectors appear as inputs or outputs on the group box that you can use to link to other components. You can hover over a free connector to see its source component, which is its name, and the input/output type, for example Condition met output.

Grouped boxes are created like alert definitions with these exceptions:

- Entry points are not required to save a grouped box.
- Connectors have three possible states: red, yellow, and green.
- When you save a grouped box, the resulting box in the definitions is a red box and its connectors are the unused input/ output connectors of its internal components. No configuration is needed when using a grouped box in a definition. The description of the configuration is the description that you type when you save the grouped box.

## Creating a Grouped Box

You can create and edit Grouped Boxes and use them in alert definitions. Grouped Boxes can contain any alert definition component and can be easily reused.

## Steps

1. From the Alerting page, click Grouped boxes .
2. Click the New element icon above the tree.
3. Edit the Grouped Box definition by dragging entry points, operations, conditions and actions on the page, and editing their parameters. Unlike alert definitions, entry points are not mandatory for grouped boxes.
4. Link the components in a logical flow for how you want the data to be evaluated.

Connectors have three states:

Green represents free input or output connectors. You can link within the scope of the Grouped Box you are working on or leave the connector free, in which case it appears as a free connector on the Grouped Box when it is used in an Alert Definition.

Red represents a connector that is linked with another element within the Grouped Box. The data flow between these connectors takes place in the Grouped Box, and the connectors are not visible and cannot be linked to in the Grouped Box.

Yellow represents connectors that have been used within an Alert Definition. You can hover over a yellow connector and see a list of the alert definitions that use it, including the component that links to it. A yellow connector cannot be linked to in the source Grouped Box as it is already occupied in one or more Alert Definitions, and it cannot be deleted until it is freed in the Alert Definitions it is linked to.

You can use a Grouped Box within another Grouped Box but not within itself. Grouped Boxes that are used within a Grouped Box display their available connectors.

5. Click Save .

## Probing alerts

Probing helps you confirm the behavior of an alert definition. Do a probe to test the elements in an alert definition in real time to see how data is evaluated at each component, and how many times actions have been triggered.

Probes help you spot problems with how you construct your alert definitions, so that you can adjust them and retest until your alerts are satisfactory. This helps you to construct ever more complex alerts to match the increasing complexity of your network.

Probing is available only to users who have write permission.

## Preparing for probing

Before you start probing, you can make these changes to improve the success of probing your alert definitions.

- Ensure the alerting sources, such as timeseries, events, text, or report data, are correctly configured to be sent to the Alerting Backend.
- Reduce the polling intervals of one or more collectors, or how often source data is sent to an Alerting Backend, so that your probing yields more results that correspond to the timeframe. If, for example, the default polling for the Smarts Collector uses four minutes, you would have to wait four minutes for every probe result. You can change the Smarts Collector to 10 seconds for the duration of the probing, and then switch it back for production.
- Reduce the sampling property that determines how many properties per data sample are preserved. This is controlled by the alerting.suggestion.sample property in the module.properties file that is located at &lt;APG&gt;/Backends/AlertingBackend/&lt;instance&gt;/conf . By default this property does not appear, and 1 in 100 properties are kept. For example if polling takes place every 10 seconds, it can take a long time to accumulate enough properties for effective probing. You can change this to 1:1 for the duration of your probing session.
- Filter hints and sampled properties are dependent on the data coming into the Alerting Backend. You can increase the number of hints and sampled properties by adding and adjusting the alerting.suggestion.sampling property in the module.properties file that is located in the conf directory of the Alerting Backend.

7. Test or clear a component or link by clicking it. The component is highlighted and its information appears in an area of the same color.

## Probing a report

You can test how a report is alerted on. This procedure has three major steps: set up a scheduled report to be alerted on and generate it, create an alerting definition for the report, and probe the alert definition.

## About this task

Notes about report probe results:

- Some components, such entry points and operations, may be less interesting to probe, as they return only their descriptions and settings.
- Actions, besides listing all their settings, show the number of times they have been executed. You can see in real time the effect the report data had on the number of times the action that is executed by watching this number during the probing session.
- Enabling links displays the information in each line of alert data according to the selections in the Probe window. Since there is no filter that all data is parsed and every property with its value appears. Depending on where the link is located in the alert definition, a subset of alerting data lines appear according to how they are routed from previous components in the chain.

## Steps

1. Set up a scheduled report to be alerted on and generate it:
- a. In the main user interface, browse to a report that contains alerting data.
- b. Using the Display menu, set the range to 1 month.
- c. Using the Tools menu, select Schedule this Report .
- d. Set the schedule to Every month .
- e. Click the Alert tab and select the Alerting Backend that contains the alert definitions to test with the data from this scheduled report.
- f. In the tree, click Scheduled Reports , right-click the report, and then click Launch now .
- g. The Report Data Adapter, which parses reports from the Frontend, is automatically created the first time that it receives a report from the Frontend to be alerted on. The Report Data Adapter is named AUTO\_CREATED\_APG\_REPORT\_ADAPTER. On the Alerting interface, change its Time check parameter to 1 (minute), so that reports that are received from the Frontend are parsed and can be probed. You can change this back to a larger interval after the alert definitions are ready for production, to reduce the load on the server that is caused by needless polling.
2. Create an alerting definition for the report:
- a. On the Alerting Frontend, click Alert Definitions &gt; Examples &gt; Multiple Severities Comparator and above the tree click the Copy and then the Paste icon. Rename it Utilization Over Month Alert.
- b. Click the newly created alert definition in the tree to display its components.
- c. Mouse over its entry point and click the pen icon to edit it.

- d. In the Edit Components dialog box that appears, delete the contents of the filter. You can change its name and description.
- e. You can add a filter later, but first test the unfiltered content using a probe, and include a filter from the Probe UI for iterative testing purposes. Alert definitions pass their data to the next component only if the state data has changed from a previous data line in a series. This is useful, for example, if instead of using the Report Data Adapter, you use the Values Socket Listener Adapter to directly input UtilizationPct metric data about the file systems that are received by the Smarts-Collector through the Collector-Manager, and do not want to continually trigger an alert when a file system is over a certain value, but only is parsed the first time it crosses the threshold, and subsequently when it is under the threshold. In this example, the report is parsed once a month and all the data are parsed to see which thresholds are crossed for each line of alerting data. Therefore, edit each Comparator condition to enable their Stateless check boxes.
- f. Save and enable the alert definition.
- g. To ensure the Report Data Adapter named AUTO\_CREATED\_APG\_REPORT\_ADAPTER is enabled, click it in the adapter list and click Enable . You can disable any other adapters so that you can concentrate on the report data being received from the APG Frontend, if this does not impact other required running alerts.
3. Probe the alert definition:
- a. From the Alerting page, click Alert Definitions .
- b. Click Utilization Over Month Alert &gt; Probe . The alert definition appears with the Probe window on the left, and space at the bottom of the screen for the probe results.
- c. Enable a few of the components and links of the alert definition to see the data flowing through them by clicking each one.

For each component or link clicked, a probe result window appears at the bottom of the screen.

- d. Open up another browser window, return to the main user interface and on the Scheduled Reports Management page, right-click the scheduled report you configured to be alerted on and click Launch now .

## Create alerts from scheduled reports

The metrics that appear on reports can be the source of an alert.

## Process flow to alert on a scheduled report

An alert might enter the system as a metric from a scheduled report.

You can configure a report for alerting using the Schedule a report tool. Data from a report that is scheduled for alerting is converted into XML form and then parsed into alerting data by the APG Report Data adapter. Report Data Adapter has a default time to check for generated xml file to 60 minutes. You can also configure the time check value to the required value.

The alerting data is sent to the Alerting Backend, where the alert definitions evaluate the alerting data. This alerting method depends on an alert definition that filters on the report name and one or more report metric names. The alert definition defines the conditions that generate an alert, such as a value that is exceeded.

You can evaluate any metric that appears on the report. You can also use operations in the alert definition to create a new metric value from the data on the report, and generate alerts on the calculated value.

## Prerequisites for creating alerts from scheduled reports

To alert on reports, all the following elements must be in place.

- The Alerting Frontend and the Alerting Backend must be configured as described in Configure the alerting engine.
- Communication between the APG Frontend and the Alerting Backend must be configured if they are on different servers. See Configure alerting communication.
- An APG Report Data Adapter must be defined in the Alerting Frontend. This adapter is created automatically the first time a report is parsed by alerting.
- Alert definitions must exist in the Alerting Frontend to gather data from the reports. The procedure Create a scheduled report alert includes how to create the appropriate alert definition.

## Configure the alerting engine

Configure the service of the Alerting Backend to make alerts accessible to the Alerting Frontend.

It is an Administrator task. Configure the Alerting Engine with the following set of JVM arguments.

Table 38. Configuring alerting engine

| alerting.suggestion.sampling  | -          | Sampling of properties catching for the suggestions. Default is 100.                                   |
| alerting.suggestion.limit     | -          | The number of values kept for each property. Default is 1000.                                          |
| alerting.mail.from            | -          | The From address of a mail action. Default is noreply@mybusiness.com.                                  |
| alerting.probe.size           | -          | Probe buffer size. Default is 5 MB.                                                                    |
| alerting.probe.ttl            | -          | Probe time to live in seconds. Default is 60 seconds.                                                  |

Although not mandatory, alerting is used with the APG values. To enable collecting these values, edit the Alerting connector in the Collecting/Collector-Manager/Default/conf/collecting.xml file from the APG installation directory. The connector should look like this:

```
<!-- This collecting component connects the collecting process to the Alerting itself, using a plain text socket. --> <connector enabled="false" name="Alerting" conf="Collector-Manager/Default/CacheConnector/conf /alertingconnector.xml" />
```

The file alertingconnector.xml creates a socket on port 2010, which is the listening port of the default APG Values Socket Listener adapter of the Alerting Backend. By enabling both the connector and the adapter, Alerting can trigger on APG values.

## Configure alerting communication

If the APG Frontend and the Alerting Frontend are not on the same server, add lines to the APG.xml file so that the Frontend knows which Alerting Backend instances it can send reports to.

## About this task

This procedure assumes that the APG Frontend and the Alerting Frontend and Backend are configured.

## Steps

1. On the server where the Alerting Frontend resides, open alerting-frontend.xml,ï  at &lt;APG&gt;/Web-Servers/Tomcat/ &lt;Instance&gt;/conf/Catalina/localhost .
2. Copy the alerting properties.

For example, if you have two Alerting Backends configured, you copy these lines:

```
<Resource name="manager/Local Manager" auth="Container" type="com.watch4net.alerting.jmx.AlertManagerFactory" factory="org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory" user="admin" pass="changeme" url="service:jmx:rmi:/ //jndi/rmi://localhost:52569/jmxrmi" /> <Resource name="manager/Second Manager" auth="Container"
```

```
type="com.watch4net.alerting.jmx.AlertManagerFactory" factory="org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory" user="admin" pass="changeme" url="service:jmx:rmi:/ //jndi/rmi://localhost:52570/jmxrmi" />
```

3. On the server where the Alerting Frontend resides, open APG.xml, at &lt;APG&gt;/Web-Servers/Tomcat/&lt;Instance&gt;/ conf/Catalina/localhost and paste the lines that you copied from the alerting-frontend.xml file anywhere in the &lt;context&gt; tags.
4. If the Alerting Frontend references the local Alerting Backend, replace localhost in each copied entry with the IP address of the Alerting Backend.
5. Restart Tomcat.

## Create a scheduled report alert

To configure alerts from scheduled report data, perform the following steps:

## Steps

1. Schedule the report for alerting:
- a. On the Console, browse to the report that has the metric you want to alert on and click Tools &gt; Schedule this report .
- b. On the Scheduling tab, define how often and when to run this report.
- c. On the Alert tab, select Local Manager .
- d. Click Save .
2. Enable the APG Report Data Adapter.
- a. Go to Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Alerts &gt; Adapters .
- b. Look for APG Report Data adapter. If it is in the list of adapters, use the table in the right pane to ensure it is enabled.

If the adapter is not listed, perform the following step.

3. (One-time step) Add the APG Report Data adapter:
- a. On the User Console, go to My Reports &gt; Scheduled Reports .
- b. In the right pane, right-click the report that you scheduled for alerting, and choose Launch now .

This action adds the APG Report Data adapter to the list of adapters if it is not already there, and enables it.

4. Create an alert definition that includes:
- a. A filter that identifies the report name and one or more metrics.
- 'reportname== report name '
- 'name== metric name '
- b. Conditions that evaluate the metric and define outcome paths. You can optionally include operations that create new metric values from the entry metric data.
- c. To make the alert appear in alerting reports, include SNMP Alert Trap and Clear Trap actions on the outcome paths. Other actions are also valid, such as log, email, or SNMP notifications.
5. Enable the alert definition.
6. Launch the report again, or wait for the next scheduled run.

Each time the report runs, the Alerting Backend receives the data and generates or clears alerts when conditions in the alert definition are met.

You can use probing to simulate conditions and test the results.

## Report data parsing

The APG Report Data adapter parses the data in the scheduled reports that it receives.

The APG Report Data adapter generates alerting data from scheduled reports. The data and related properties depend on the report type.

Each data point in a report, such as a point in a graph or a table row with a value column, results in a line of data that can be evaluated by an alert definition.

## Common properties

Each line of alerting data output by the APG Report Data adapter has the following properties.

Timestamp Value Name ReportName

The displayed properties with their values from the header of the report are included with the lines of alerting data from the report. If it is a mixed report, the lines of alerting data from each child report have these common properties, although usually properties are used only in individual reports for a single device.

## Tables

Each row of a table report results in one line of alerting data per value column that can be evaluated by an alert definition.

- The value column of the table is used for alert definition evaluation, unless something else is specified for evaluation, such as a field in a string operation.
- The column name of the value column is used as the property value of the name property. The name is what the report editor named the column.
- Data from other table columns are input as additional properties, with their column names used as the property names. The name is what the report editor named the column.

## Graphs

In a standard time-series graph, each timestamp (point on the graph), generates a line of alert data that can be evaluated. In a graph with four lines (metrics), at each timestamp there are four lines of data.

The value of the property name is derived from the legend, even if the legend is hidden as it is in Mixed Reports.

For horizontal bar and pie charts, each category in the graph results in a line of alerting data that contains the following information:

- Relative value in percentage of the metric compared to the other categories.
- Value of the name property, which is the name of the report.
- Timestamp of each line of alerting data, which, for these types of reports, corresponds to the time when the report was generated instead of the period of time that the report covers. Do not use these types of reports for time-based alerting.
- Section property for each line of alerting data, which corresponds to the legend for the category reported on in the data.
- The absoluteValue, which is the absolute value of the metric for the category for the report period.
- The totalValue, which is the sum of the absolute values for every category in the graph.

## Baseline graphs

Baseline graphs are like other time series graphs with these additional characteristics:

- One alerting data line is created for each timestamp with the value of the metric and its name, according to the contents of the legend, using the value of the name property.
- The baselineValue property is added, which is an average for the metric at the specified time over the last month.
- The baselineMin is added, which is the minimum value that is recorded for the metric at the specified time over the last month.
- The baselineMax is added, which is the maximum value that is recorded for the metric at the specified time over the last month.

You can use a formula to vary the length of the baseline instead of using the default, which is the past 4 weeks.
