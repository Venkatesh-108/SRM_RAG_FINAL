It enables you to visualize applications to storage dependencies, monitor, and analyze configurations and capacity growth. It also optimizes the environment to improve return on investment.\n\nVirtualization enables businesses of all sizes to simplify management, control costs, and guarantee uptime. However, virtualized environments also add layers of complexity to the IT infrastructure that reduce visibility and can complicate the management of storage resources. Dell SRM addresses these layers by providing visibility into the physical and virtual relationships to ensure consistent service levels. Dell SRM helps you ensure storage service levels while optimizing IT resources-both key attributes of successful cloud deployments.\n\n## New features\n\nThe following features were added in this release:\n\nTable 2.

depending on the selected formatter, require more accurate data (ex: multiple points VS a single point). When we only need one point, we can request it directly, selecting the closest aggregate period that does not exceed an arbitrary margin error. Requesting more accurate data, we cannot do that and have to rely on a smaller aggregate, sometimes even real time. This does not select the same data (because in the first case, the range was extended or reduced to fit the selected aggregate). When your data is not stable and fluctuates a lot, it then happens that a high profile value gets selected in one case and not in the other, thus the observed difference. Besides, it also happens that database aggregation handles metric aggregation as well (aka spatial aggregation). In order not to overweight a metric compared to the others, we also reset any aggregation count to 1, which then results in a different average than if it were all done on temporal values, they on spatial ones. This behavior is even increased with formulas as they can decide to void a metric's count, which will | There is no workaround available. |\n\nTable 4.

However, it populates with data quickly (usually within 1 s by 07:30:01 the data is present). | ● Data collection stops for performance metrics exactly at every fifth minute interval.

In Dell EMC SRM 4.4, discover PURE array using any Friendly name followed by data collection. 2. Upgrade to any of the higher builds such as Dell EMC SRM 4.5 and above. 3. After the successful upgrade and after latest data collection (after the polling cycle), duplicate entries are seen. For example, if there are 54-Volumes that are seen before the upgrade for the respective PURE array, now after upgrade, it will be double and displayed as 108-Volumes.

Therefore, the compliance rule Snapshot Policy With Undefined Retention cannot be supported. ● From Unisphere version 10.2, due to changes in the response from the REST API (sloprovisioning), the values for Raw Capacity and Configured Raw Capacity will be the same, Unconfigured Capacity will be zero, and Hot Spare will not be applicable. These changes are seen across all PowerMax OS versions. Additionally, RAID Overhead Capacity will be empty for PowerMaxOS 10.x. ● For the PowerMax V4 arrays with PowerMaxOS 10.x, the Efficiency metric is not available/supported.

Therefore, metrics such as VPUsedCapacity , SpaceSavedCapacity , SpaceSavedPercent PhysicalUsedCapacity , PhysicalFreeCapacity , PotentialFreeCapacity , LogicalUsedCapacity , ConfiguredRawCapacity , and UnconfiguredCapacity are affected. |\n| SolutionPack for IBM FlashSystem  | ● IBM FlashSystem series do not support Snapshot Group, Consistency Group, and Grid Controller. ● IBM FlashSystem for Port Performance do not support Throughput and Latency columns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| SolutionPack for Huawei OceanStor | ● SRM does not consider Protection Group(s) as members of HyperCDP Schedule policy.
