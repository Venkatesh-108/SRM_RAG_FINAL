Right-click the vApp and select **Shut Down**. Wait for all VMs in the vApp to shut down completely.\n\n_Important Note:_ You must use the **vCenter export and import procedure**. Do not use the **vCenter remove from inventory method**.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\nNone (the context does not provide a step-by-step procedure for deploying scaleout VMs in an existing vApp)\n\nDell SRM supports adding additional backends and collectors either inside or outside of the SRM vApp, but the context only provides information on using this feature to deploy scaleout VMs **inside** of the SRM vApp.\n\nThe context does not contain sufficient information to answer this question completely.",
