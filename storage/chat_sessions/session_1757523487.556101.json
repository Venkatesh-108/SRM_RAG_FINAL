You can add the Collector through Administration Config > Settings > Configure Servers > Register a Server .\n\nIf you have multiple remote vApp collectors, you can use the launch-collector-configuration.sh -c /sw/srmhosts script and register the Collectors through Config > Settings > Configure Servers > Register a Server . For details about using the SRM-Config-Tool, see Dell SRM configuration tools.\n\nDatabase grants for Collector hosts are not required.\n\nUse the following procedure to add a binary Collector.\n\nNOTE: For Windows, use .cmd instead of .sh , and / instead of \\ for directories.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Install the Dell SRM software as described in Installing on Linux or Installing on Windows Server.\n2. Configure the binary collectors:\n- a. Browse to the following directory:\n\nLinux: cd /opt/APG/bin\n\nWindows: cd Program Files/APG/bin\n\n- b. Run the Collector configuration script:\n\nlaunch-collector-configuration.sh -c /sw/srm-hosts\n\n- c. Verify that all the services are running:\n\nmanage-modules.sh service status all\n\n3. On the Frontend, run the following command:\n\nlaunch-frontend-scale-collector.sh -c /sw/srm-hosts\n\n4. Verify the Remote Collector configuration through the Dell SRM UI.\n\n\nThis information is not available in the provided Dell SRM documentation.",
