      "content": "## Introduction to guidelines for deploying additional frontend servers.\n*Chapter: Document Introduction*\n*Page: 1*\n\n\nThe performance and scalability guidelines recommend that you have one Frontend Server for every 10 active and concurrent users. If you plan on having more than 10 users, you must deploy more Frontend Servers. Using a load balancer to distribute processing among multiple Frontend Servers is highly recommended. Another use case for deploying additional Frontend Servers is to offload the scheduled report from the Primary Frontend Server to improve UI performance.\n\nAlthough this guide covers the F5 and HAproxy load balancers, you can use the load balancer of your choice. These two load balancers are provided as examples in the section 'Architecture with network Load Balancers.'\n\nIn a multiple Frontend Server environment, only one Frontend Server should handle the web- applications that are listed under the Administrator panel. These web-applications are:\n\n- Alerting-Frontend\n- APG-Web-Service\n- Administration\n- Compliance Frontend\n- Device-Discovery\n- MIB-Browser\n\nThe first installed Frontend Server is now called the Primary Frontend Server and the subsequent Frontend Server installed is called the Additional Frontend Server. The Primary Frontend Server provides all the SRM functionality (user and Administration) while the Additional Frontend Server only provides user functions.\n\nWhen a user logs in to an Additional Frontend Server, all user-related reports and functions are available through the Additional Frontend Server the user logged into. If the user is in the Administration UI and selects any of the administration functions available in this UI, the user will be redirected to the Primary Frontend Server and forced to log in again to the Primary Frontend Server.\n\n## Architecture overview\n\nWithout network load balancers, the user would log into one of the installed Frontend Servers (Primary or Additional). Users are typically assigned to a frontend for SRM environments that have greater than 10 concurrent user activity.\n\n## Topics:\n\n\n## Additional frontend server configuration\n*Chapter: Document Introduction*\n*Page: 6*\n\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Manually start the Save Frontend VM.\n2. Copy the files that are listed below from the Primary Frontend Server to the Additional Frontend Server.\n3. NOTE: You can use the scp command to do it or WinSCP. Dell Technologies recommends that you back up the files on the Additional Frontend Server before overwriting them.\n4. …/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/&lt;instance-name&gt;/conf/server.xml\n5. …/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/&lt;instance-name&gt;/conf/Catalina/localhost/APG.xml\n6. …/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/&lt;instance-name&gt;/conf/Catalina/localhost/APG-WS.xml\n7. …/APG/Tools/Frontend-Report-Generator/&lt;instance-name&gt;/conf/report-generation- config.xml\n8. …/APG/Tools/Administration-Tool/&lt;instance-name&gt;/conf/master-accessor-service-conf.xml\n9. …/APG/Tools/WhatIf-Scenario-CLI/&lt;instance-name&gt;/conf/whatif-scenario-cli-conf.xml\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\n## Consolidate the scheduled reports\n*Chapter: Document Introduction*\n*Page: 12*\n\n\nDell Technologies recommends consolidating the scheduling of reports to an Additional Frontend Server. Follow the procedure in this section to consolidate the already scheduled reports to the Additional Frontend Server.\n\n## About this task\n\nIf scheduling of reports will be distributed across all Frontend Servers (Primary and Additional) then skip this section.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. On the Primary Frontend Server, go to the scheduled reports directory:\n\ncd /opt/APG/Tools/Task-Scheduler/Default/data/task\\_repository/scheduled-reports/\n\n2. Copy the files from the scheduled-reports directory on the Primary Frontend Server to the same directory of the Additional Frontend Server.\n\nscp -R * root@Additional FE:/opt/APG/Tools/Task-scheduler/Default/data/\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- NOTE: If the scheduled-reports folder is missing, then copy the folder from the Primary Frontend Server. The folder will be missing if no reports have been scheduled from the new Additional Frontend Server.\n\nReview the scheduled-reports directory to have all the files that are consolidated from the Primary Frontend Server to the Additional Frontend Server\n\n3. Remove the scheduled-reports director from the Primary Frontend Server.\n\ncd …/APG/Custom/WebApps-Resources/Default/scheduling\n\n4. Edit scheduling-servers.xml and change: url=\"https://localhost:48443/\" --&gt; url=https://&lt;Additional FQDN&gt;:48443/\n5. On the Additional Frontend Server, go to the scheduled reports directory:\n\n/opt/APG/Tools/Task-Scheduler/Default/data/task\\_repository/\n\n6. Change the files (and the scheduled-reports directory is it was copied to the Additional Frontend Server) to be owned by apg.\n\nchown apg:apg -R *",

      "content": "Based on the provided context and additional information, here is a comprehensive guide to database configuration for Dell SolutionPack Reports:\n\n**SolutionPacks Report Installation**\n\n1.  The primary frontend server should be selected in the interactive installation window for SolutionPacks.\n2.  The report is transferred from the frontend server to the MySQL database and will be visible on all frontend servers.\n\n**SolutionPacks Upload**\n\nSince administration performs the upload, the operation takes place on the primary frontend server. The package file is saved locally and can only be installed from this primary frontend server. If the primary frontend server is in a high availability solution, the folder must be updated as well.\n\n**SolutionPack Formula**\n\nA SolutionPack can have a local formula that is built in a Java file used in the reports. The formula is installed on the Frontend Server pointed to during installation. The SolutionPack that has a custom formula contains a Java file in the `blocks/reports/templates/arp_formulas` folder. Currently, the only SolutionPack affected is the Dell SolutionPack which uses the formula.\n\n**Additional Frontend Server Deployment**\n\n1.  Install the Additional Frontend Server from the 1VM vApp deployment software or using the binary deployment software.\n2.  Run the Frontend and all Database servers as Linux operating systems when the metric count is greater than 5M:\n    *   Ensure the Frontend Server is installed as described in the Dell SRM Installation and Configuration Guide.\n    *   After deploying Additional Frontend Servers, if the existing SRM Servers are in a vApp folder, move the new Additional Frontend Server into the vApp folder and edit the vApp Start-up order to start the Additional Frontend Server with the Primary Frontend Server.\n\n**Adding MySQL Grants to Databases**\n\n1.  Grant remote access to databases \\ `<Database>` on the primary backend server `Primary Backend Server` from the additional frontend servers `Additional Frontend Server <Host FQDN>`.\n    *   Run this command:\n        ```bash\n./mysql-command-runner.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/Default/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml  -Q \"CREATE USER 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password AS '*FA71926E39A02D4DA4843003DF34BEADE3920AF3'\"; ./mysql-command-runner.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/Default/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml  -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\" ./mysql-command-runner-apg1.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg1/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg1.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>;\"\n```\n    *   Repeat the same command for the other databases:\n        ```bash\n./mysql-command-runner-apg2.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg2/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg2.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>;\" ./mysql-command-runner-apg3.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg3/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg3.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>;\" ./mysql-command-runner-apg4.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg4/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg4.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>;\"`\n1.  Grant remote access to `apg` databases on the additional backend servers from the additional frontend servers.\n    *   Run these commands:\n        ```bash\n./mysql-command-runner-apg1.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg1/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"CREATE USER 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password AS '*FA71926E39A02D4DA4843003DF34BEADE3920AF3'\";\n        ./mysql-command-runner-apg2.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg2/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg1.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>;\";\n        ./mysql-command-runner-apg3.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg3/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg2.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>;\";\n        ./mysql-command-runner-apg4.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg4/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg3.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>;\";\n```\n\n**Configuring Compliance**\n\n1.  If compliance has been installed, run the following command on the additional frontend server:\n    *   Run this command:\n        ```bash\n.../APG/bin/administration-tool.sh updateModule -module [ -name 'storage_compliance' -url 'http://<FQDN-Primary-Frontend-server>:58080/compliance-frontend/' ]\n```\n\n**LDAP Authentication**\n\n1.  If LDAP authentication has been configured on the primary frontend server, copy the Realm configuration file and certificate from the primary frontend server to the additional frontend servers:\n    *   Copy the Realm configuration file from the primary frontend server to the additional frontend servers:\n        ```bash\n...APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/conf/realms-configuration.xml\n```\n    *   Copy the certificate file from the primary frontend server to the additional frontend server:\n        ```\n...APG/Java/Sun-JRE/&lt;Java version&gt;/lib/security\n```",
