Run the following command to grant remote access to the `apg` database on the Primary Backend Server:\n```\n./mysql-command-runner.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/Default/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml  -Q \"CREATE USER 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password AS '*FA71926E39A02D4DA4843003DF34BEADE3920AF3'\";\n```\nReplace `<Host FQDN>` with the FQDN of your Additional Frontend Server.\n\n2. Grant all privileges on the `apg` database:\n```\n./mysql-command-runner.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/Default/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml  -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\"\n```\n3. Grant all privileges on other databases (e.g., `compliance`, `events`, `master`, and `topology`) on the Primary Backend Server:\n```\n./mysql-command-runner.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/Default/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml  -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON compliance.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\"\n./mysql-command-runner.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/Default/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml  -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON events.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\"\n./mysql-command-runner.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/Default/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml  -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON master.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\"\n./mysql-command-runner.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/Default/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml  -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON topology.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\"\n```\n4. Run the same commands on each Additional Backend Server to grant remote access to the `apg` database and other databases:\n```bash\n./mysql-command-runner-apg1.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg1/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"CREATE USER 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password AS '*FA71926E39A02D4DA4843003DF34BEADE3920AF3';\"\n./mysql-command-runner-apg2.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg2/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg1.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\"\n./mysql-command-runner-apg3.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg3/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg2.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\"\n./mysql-command-runner-apg4.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apg4/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apg3.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\"\n```\n**Configuring Compliance**\n\nIf Compliance has been installed, run the following command on each Additional Frontend Server:\n```bash\n…/APG/bin/administration-tool.sh updateModule -module [ -name 'storage_compliance' -url 'http://<FQDN-Primary-Frontend-server>:58080/compliance-frontend/' ]\n```\n**Configuring LDAP Authentication**\n\nIf LDAP authentication has been configured on the Primary Frontend Server, copy the Realm-configuration file and certificate file to each Additional Frontend Server:\n```bash\n…/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/conf/realms-configuration.xml\n…/APG/Java/Sun-JRE/&lt;Java version&gt;/lib/security\n```\n**Importing Properties Task**\n\nEdit the `import-properties.task` file on each Additional Frontend Server to delay the execution of the scripts with respect to the Primary Frontend Server:\n```bash\n…/APG/Databases/APG-Property-Store/&lt;instance-name&gt;/conf/importproperties.tas\n```\nReplace `<instance-name>` with the instance name.\n\nOn the Primary Frontend Server, use the following configuration:\n```bash\n<!-If the average of the last 5 executions takes < 1 hour, schedule at 5:00AM and 12:00PM -->\n<conditional condition=\"slidingFinishedAverageDuration &lt; 3600000\">\n  <schedule cron=\"0 5,12 * * *\" xsi:type=\"schedule-repeated\" disabled=\"false\"></schedule>\n</conditional>\n```\nOn each Additional Frontend Server, use the following configuration:\n```bash\n<!-If the average of the last 5 executions takes < 1 hour, schedule at 1:00AM, 6:00AM, 1:00PM, 6:00PM -->\n<conditional condition=\"slidingFinishedAverageDuration &lt; 3600000\">\n  <schedule cron=\"1 6,13 * * *\" xsi:type=\"schedule-repeated\" disabled=\"false\"></schedule>\n</conditional>\n```\nOn each Additional Frontend Server, use a 2-hour delay:\n```bash\n<!-If the average of the last 5 executions takes < 1 hour, schedule at 2:00AM, 7:00AM, 2:00PM, 7:00PM -->\n<conditional condition=\"slidingFinishedAverageDuration &lt; 3600000\">\n  <schedule cron=\"2 7,14 * * *\" xsi:type=\"schedule-repeated\" disabled=\"false\"></schedule>\n</conditional>\n```\n**Verifying MySQL Database Grants**\n\nRun the following command on each Additional Frontend Server to verify the MySQL database grants:\n```bash\n/opt/APG/bin/mysql-client.sh\nmysql> SELECT user, host, db, select_priv, insert_priv, grant_priv FROM mysql.db;\n```\nVerify that the `apg` user has all privileges on the `apg`, `compliance`, `events`, `master`, and `topology` databases.",

      "content": "Based on the provided context, here is a complete guide on how to add additional MySQL grants:\n\n**Adding MySQL Grants to Databases**\n\nThe goal is to grant remote access to databases `<Database>` on the Primary Backend Server and apg databases on the Additional Backend Servers from the Additional Frontend Server.\n\n1. Run the following command to grant remote access to databases `<Database>` on the Primary Backend Server:\n\n```\n./mysql-command-runner.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/Default/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml  -Q \"CREATE USER 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password AS '*FA71926E39A02D4DA4843003DF34BEADE3920AF3'\";\n```\n\n2. Grant all privileges on the `<Database>` database:\n\n```sql\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <Database>.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\n```\n\nRepeat this process for each of the following databases:\n\n* `apg` database\n\n**Granting Remote Access to Additional Backend Servers**\n\nFor each additional backend server, run the following command to grant remote access:\n\n1. Create a user:\n\n```bash\n./mysql-command-runner-apgX.sh -c /opt/APG/Tools/MySQL-Maintenance-Tool/apgX/conf/mysqlroot-mysql.xml -Q \"CREATE USER 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password AS '*FA71926E39A02D4DA4843003DF34BEADE3920AF3'\";\n```\n\nReplace `apgX` with the corresponding number (e.g., apg1, apg2, etc.).\n\n2. Grant all privileges on the `<Database>` database:\n\n```sql\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <Database>.* to 'apg'@'<Host FQDN>';\n```\n\nRepeat this process for each of the following databases:\n\n* `apg` database\n\n**Configuring Compliance**\n\nIf Compliance has been installed, run the following command on the Additional Frontend Server:\n\n```bash\n.../APG/bin/administration-tool.sh updateModule -module [ -name 'storage_compliance' -url 'http://<FQDN-Primary-Frontend-server>:58080/compliance-frontend/' ]\n```\n\n**LDAP Authentication**\n\nIf LDAP authentication has been configured on the Primary Frontend Server, copy the Realm-configuration File from the Primary Frontend Server to the Additional Frontend Servers:\n\n```bash\n.../APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/conf/realms-configuration.xml\n```\n\nAlso, copy the certificate file from the Primary Frontend Server to the Additional Frontend Server:\n\n```bash\n...APG/Java/Sun-JRE/<Java version>/lib/security\n```\n\n**Import-Properties Task**\n\nEach Frontend Server has to run the import-property task. If the import-properties task completes in under 30 minutes, use the defaults. If the task takes 30 minutes or longer, use a 1 hour start time difference for the import-properties task on the Additional Frontend Server.\n\nTo edit the import-properties.task file, navigate to:\n\n```bash\n...APG/Databases/APG-Property-Store/<instance-name>/conf/importproperties.tas\n```\n\nUpdate the default configuration as follows:\n\n```html\n<!-- If the average of the last 5 executions takes < 1 hour, schedule at 5:00AM and 12:00PM -->\n<conditional condition=\"slidingFinishedAverageDuration < 3600000\">\n    <schedule cron=\"0 5,12 * * *\" xsi:type=\"schedule-repeated\" disabled=\"false\"></schedule>\n</conditional>\n\n<!-- If the average of the last 5 executions takes < 1 hour, schedule at 1:00AM, 6:00AM, 1:00PM, 6:00PM -->\n<conditional condition=\"slidingFinishedAverageDuration < 3600000\">\n    <schedule cron=\"1 6,13 * * *\" xsi:type=\"schedule-repeated\" disabled=\"false\"></schedule>\n</conditional>\n\n<!-- If the average of the last 5 executions takes < 1 hour, schedule at 2:00AM, 7:00AM, 2:00PM, 7:00PM -->\n<conditional condition=\"slidingFinishedAverageDuration < 3600000\">\n    <schedule cron=\"2 7,14 * * *\" xsi:type=\"schedule-repeated\" disabled=\"false\"></schedule>\n</conditional>\n```\n\n**Verifying MySQL Database Grants**\n\nAfter installing and configuring the Dell SRM hosts, cross-check the grant privileges that are configured for the Dell SRM servers listed in the SRM-Conf-Tools configuration file.\n\nNote:\n\n* For mysql-client.sh to work on RHEL8.x, RHEL9.x, and SLES 15 SP4, libncurses.so.x is required. Example: RHEL 9\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /lib64/libncurses.so.6 /lib64/libtinfo.so.6\n```\n\n**Steps to Verify MySQL Database Grants**\n\n1. Run the following script:\n\n```bash\n./mysql-client.sh\n```\n\n2. When prompted, select `root` as the username, `mysql` for the database, and `watch4net` as the password.\n3. Run the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT user, host, db, select_priv, insert_priv, grant_priv FROM mysql.db;\n```\n\n**Example**\n\nThe following table is an example of the configuration that you should see on an Additional Backend host:\n\n| User | Host | DB | Select Priv | Insert Priv | Grant Priv |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| apg | <Host FQDN> | all databases | * | * | ALL PRIVILEGES |\n\nMake sure the table reflects the correct configuration for your environment.",

Adjust the Collector VM memory.\n2. Adjust the Collector VM CPUs.\n3. To conform to naming policies, change the vApp VM name in vCenter.\n4. Increase the VM storage per VM.\n5. Move the vApp VM storage to its assigned datastore.\n6. Modify the vApp container startup order.\n\n## Adjusting the VMs\n\nThe Collectors (and possibly the Frontend) need the number of CPUs, the size, and the memory adjusted based on the Dell SRM design. To make these updates, edit the settings of each Collector vApp VM.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Change the vApp VMs name to default VM to meet VM naming standards.\n2. Edit the VM settings and select the Options tab to make the updates.\n\n## Adding disk space\n\nAll vApp VMs are deployed with 132 GB of storage. Each Dell SRM VM needs larger storage. The total Dell SRM VM storage size is based on the Dell SRM design. Edit the settings of each vApp VM and add a VMDK (virtual machine disk). Subtract 132 GB from the total storage size that is specified in the sizing plan that is provided by Dell, and add a VMDK (virtual machine disk) with the size of the additional storage needed. The VM can be running during this process.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. From the vCenter Console, select the individual VM where you want to add new disk storage.\n2. Select Edit Settings on the virtual machine and click Add .\n3. Select Hard Disk and click Next .\n4. Select Create a new virtual disk and click Next .\n5. Specify the disk size, the provisioning type, the location of the disk and click Next .\n6. Specify the virtual device node (the default value should be OK ) and click Next .\n7. Review the options and click Finish .\n8. After Dell SRM is up and running, connect to the Linux host. You can access a login prompt through the vCenter Client console or using an SSH tool such as PuTTY.\n9. At the root command prompt, type the command expand\\_disk.pl .\n\nThe script merges the new VMDK with the existing files system while the VM is still running. Use the df -h command when the script is finished to see the new file system size.\n\nNOTE: Using this script extends maximum 1000 GB disk space in one execution.\n\n## DataStores\n\nThe 4VM vApp deployment places the 4 VMs on a single DataStore. Migrate the VM from this DataStore to its assigned DataStore. The required storage per Dell SRM VM can be found in the design that is provided by Dell.\n\nFor reference, the target storage sizes are as follows:\n\n- Frontend - 320 GB\n- Primary Backend - 800 GB and larger\n- Additional Backends - 1 TB and larger\n- Collector - 300 GB or larger\n\nWith the VM in a powered off state, use the Storage vMotion feature to move the VM to a new DataStore.",

To accomplish this, an NFS Share is required from a NAS Server, exported with Read/Write permissions for each Frontend Server.\n\n- NOTE: The NFS Share should be a minimum of 1 GB and have the abilities to expand at the NAS server. For the average customer environment, 1 GB should be sufficient, but for a larger user environment, you may want to start with a 3 GB or 5 GB NFS file system.\n- NOTE: Dell does not support installing an NFS Server on the Linux vApp VM.\n\nOnce the NFS File System has been established and exported, follow these steps to add the NFS share to Dell SRM.\n\n- NOTE: For the example configuration below, the NFS Share is name SRM-FE-apg-reports-nfs.\n\n## About this task\n\nPreserve the data on the Primary Frontend Server if the SRM is not a new configuration. If this is a new environment, then skip step 1:\n\n## Steps\n\n1. On the Primary Frontend Server, rename the apg-report director to: apg-reports-old\n\n…/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/temp/apg-reports\n\n2. On all the Frontend Servers, edit the /etc/fstab file.\n3. Add this line to the bottom of the fstab file on all Frontend Servers and save:\n\n&lt;nas Ip-Address&gt;:/SRM-FE-apg-reports-nfs /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apg-reports nfs defaults\n\n```\nIppa028:/etc # more fstab Devpts   / dev/ pts          devpts  mode=0620, gid=5  0  0 proc     /proc               proc        defaults      0  0 Sysfs    / sys               sysfs       noauto        0  0 debugfs  /sys/kernel/debug   debugfs   noauto          0  0 Usbfs    /proc/bus/usb       usbfs  noauto             0  0 tmpfs    /run                tmpfs    noauto           0  0 /dev/systemVG/LVRoot / xfs defaults  1  1 /dev/sda1 /boot ext3 defaults  1  2 /dev/mapper/systemVG-Lvswap none swap defaults  0  0 10.247.25.121:/SRM-FE=apg-reports-nfs  /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apg-reports nfs defaults 1  1\n```\n\n4. Create a new directory on /opt/APG ➔ mkdir nfs-shared .\n5. Go to /opt/APG/nfs-shared ➔ mkdir apg-reports.\n6. Cd Change owner ➔ chown -R apg:apg *\n7. Mount the NFS share ➔ mount /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apg-reports.\n8. Go to ➔ /opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/temp.\n9. Delete apg-reports if the directory exists ➔ mkdir apg-reports .\n10. To create a symbolic link ➔ ln -s /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apg-reports.\n11.

Go to the apg-report directory ➔ /opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/temp/apg- reports.\n13. Verify that the NFS share has R/W privileges by creating a file from each of the Frontend Servers. You should have a minimum of two test files in the apg-reports folder ➔ touch test-file# .\n14. Verify that these files are seen from each of the Frontend Servers.\n15. On the Primary Frontend Server, go to apg-reports-old.\n\nNow copy the data from the apg-reports-old directory to the NFS Share apg-reports. cp -R * /opt/APG/WebServers/Tomcat/Default/temp/apg-reports\n\n16. Ensure that the files are owned by apg user ➔ chown apg:apg -R *\n17. Remove the test-files ➔ rm test*\n18. After the reports have been copied to the NFS Share, the apg-reports-old directory can be removed with ➔ rm -r /opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/temp/apg-reports-old\n\n```\nIppa 028: /opt/APG/Web-Servers/ Tomcat/ Default/ temp/ apg-reports # Is -als total 24 8 drwxr-xr-x  6  apg   apg   1024 May    4  16:00  . 0 drwxr-xr-x  3  root  root    24 May    4  15:44  . . 8 drwxr-xr-x  2  apg   apg   1024 May    4  15:35 . etc 0 -rw-r--r--  1  apg   ap       0 May    4  15:57 test-file-1 0  -rw-r--r-- 1  apg   apg      0 May    4  15:56 test-file-2 8 drwxr-xr-x  2  apg   apg   1024 May    4  16:00 user-1 0 drwxr-xr-x  2  apg   apg     80 May    4  16:00 user-7\n```\n\n\n## Using the Discovery Wizard\n*Chapter: Reconfiguring the LBC, Generic-SNMP, and GenericRSC*\n*Page: 39*\n\n\nThe Discovery Wizard is a tool to ease the initial deployment and configuration of the most commonly used SolutionPacks. After upgrading to SRM 4.2 or later, you may want to use the Discovery Wizard to quickly enable the SolutionPacks, and add the corresponding devices that you would like to report on. In a few simple steps you can now add the devices, monitor the collection process, and then go to the reports to see the data.\n\n## About this task\n\nThese steps use the VMAX 3/VMAX All Flash SolutionPack as an example.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Log in to the user interface at https://&lt;Frontend-hostname&gt;:58443/APG .\n\nThe default username is admin . The default password is changeme .\n\n2. Access the Discovery Wizard from the admin page: Administration &gt; DISCOVERY &gt; Discovery Wizard .\n3. On the License page, do one of the following and click Continue .\n3. NOTE: To support the XML based license features with SRM, the configuration property must be updated.\n- For more details on configuring the XML license property, see Dell SRM Administrator Guide.\n- You can add a permanent license by drag-and-dropping the file onto the license box.\n4. On the Storage Collection page, do the following and click Continue .\n- a. Type the FQDN or IP address of the Unisphere for VMAX host.\n- b. Type the login credential and port number.\n5. On the Confirm Storage page lists the detected arrays.\n- a. Select the arrays from which you want to collect data.\n\nThe meter at the bottom indicates how many more volumes you can collect before you exceed the limit.\n\n- b. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue when you have finished adding arrays.\n2. NOTE: The Confirm Storage page only applies to VMAX systems.\n6. On the Fabric Collection page, select Brocade (SMI-S) or Cisco (SNMP) from the drop-down list. Type the credentials and configuration options for the switch. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue .\n\nBrocade SAN discovery with this wizard is through Brocade SMI-S only. This solution provides limited switch performance and topology information with WWNs. The Brocade SMI-S Data Collector that is deployed with the 4VM Collector is configured to discover everything through SMI-S. When you deploy the Brocade SolutionPack, the SMI-S Data Collector is configured to restrict the data collection to zoning only. It is a best practice to discover the Brocade SAN using SMIS-S for zoning and SNMP for everything else. It provides performance metrics, and the topology shows friendly names.\n\n7. On the Fabric Collection page, select Brocade (SNMP+SMI-S) or Cisco (SNMP) from the drop-down list. Type the credentials and configuration options for the switch. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue . Brocade SAN discovery with this wizard is through Brocade SMI-S &amp; SNMP. This solution provides limited switch performance and topology information with WWNs. The Brocade SMI-S Data Collector that is deployed with the 4VM Collector is configured to discover everything through SMI-S &amp; SNMP. When you deploy the Brocade SolutionPack, the SMI-S Data Collector is configured to restrict the data collection to zoning only. It is a best practice to discover the Brocade\n\nSAN using SMIS-S for zoning and SNMP for everything else. It provides performance metrics, and the topology shows friendly names.\n\n8. Click Start Collection and Continue on the Compute Collection page, type the credentials for the VMware vSphere vSAN &amp; VxRail Server.\n9. The Collection Status page displays the status of the data collection and provides links to the next steps. Click Restart to repeat this process for each of the device types.\n10. Remove any pre-installed SolutionPacks and collectors that you do not plan to use:\n- a. Access the UI at https:// &lt;Frontend-hostname&gt; /APG .\n- b. Type the login credentials. The default username is admin . The default password is changeme .\n- c. Browse to Administration &gt; Config &gt; SolutionPacks &gt; Installed SolutionPacks .\n- d. Click the SolutionPack that you want to uninstall.\n- e. Click the Trashcan icon for each component.\n- f. Click Remove .\n11. See the Dell SRM SolutionPack Guide for details about installing SolutionPacks that were not pre-installed.\n\nThis chapter includes the following topics:\n\n## Topics:",

To accomplish this, an NFS Share is required from a NAS Server, exported with Read/Write permissions for each Frontend Server.\n\n- NOTE: The NFS Share should be a minimum of 1 GB and have the abilities to expand at the NAS server. For the average customer environment, 1 GB should be sufficient, but for a larger user environment, you may want to start with a 3 GB or 5 GB NFS file system.\n- NOTE: Dell does not support installing an NFS Server on the Linux vApp VM.\n\nOnce the NFS File System has been established and exported, follow these steps to add the NFS share to Dell SRM.\n\n- NOTE: For the example configuration below, the NFS Share is name SRM-FE-apg-reports-nfs.\n\n## About this task\n\nPreserve the data on the Primary Frontend Server if the SRM is not a new configuration. If this is a new environment, then skip step 1:\n\n## Steps\n\n1. On the Primary Frontend Server, rename the apg-report director to: apg-reports-old\n\n…/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/temp/apg-reports\n\n2.

After upgrading to SRM 4.2 or later, you may want to use the Discovery Wizard to quickly enable the SolutionPacks, and add the corresponding devices that you would like to report on. In a few simple steps you can now add the devices, monitor the collection process, and then go to the reports to see the data.\n\n## About this task\n\nThese steps use the VMAX 3/VMAX All Flash SolutionPack as an example.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Log in to the user interface at https://&lt;Frontend-hostname&gt;:58443/APG .\n\nThe default username is admin . The default password is changeme .\n\n2. Access the Discovery Wizard from the admin page: Administration &gt; DISCOVERY &gt; Discovery Wizard .\n3. On the License page, do one of the following and click Continue .\n3. NOTE: To support the XML based license features with SRM, the configuration property must be updated.\n- For more details on configuring the XML license property, see Dell SRM Administrator Guide.\n- You can add a permanent license by drag-and-dropping the file onto the license box.\n4. On the Storage Collection page, do the following and click Continue .\n- a. Type the FQDN or IP address of the Unisphere for VMAX host.\n- b. Type the login credential and port number.\n5. On the Confirm Storage page lists the detected arrays.\n- a. Select the arrays from which you want to collect data.\n\nThe meter at the bottom indicates how many more volumes you can collect before you exceed the limit.\n\n- b. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue when you have finished adding arrays.\n2. NOTE: The Confirm Storage page only applies to VMAX systems.\n6. On the Fabric Collection page, select Brocade (SMI-S) or Cisco (SNMP) from the drop-down list. Type the credentials and configuration options for the switch. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue .\n\nBrocade SAN discovery with this wizard is through Brocade SMI-S only. This solution provides limited switch performance and topology information with WWNs. The Brocade SMI-S Data Collector that is deployed with the 4VM Collector is configured to discover everything through SMI-S. When you deploy the Brocade SolutionPack, the SMI-S Data Collector is configured to restrict the data collection to zoning only. It is a best practice to discover the Brocade SAN using SMIS-S for zoning and SNMP for everything else. It provides performance metrics, and the topology shows friendly names.\n\n7. On the Fabric Collection page, select Brocade (SNMP+SMI-S) or Cisco (SNMP) from the drop-down list. Type the credentials and configuration options for the switch. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue . Brocade SAN discovery with this wizard is through Brocade SMI-S &amp; SNMP. This solution provides limited switch performance and topology information with WWNs. The Brocade SMI-S Data Collector that is deployed with the 4VM Collector is configured to discover everything through SMI-S &amp; SNMP.

It is a best practice to discover the Brocade\n\nSAN using SMIS-S for zoning and SNMP for everything else. It provides performance metrics, and the topology shows friendly names.\n\n8. Click Start Collection and Continue on the Compute Collection page, type the credentials for the VMware vSphere vSAN &amp; VxRail Server.\n9. The Collection Status page displays the status of the data collection and provides links to the next steps. Click Restart to repeat this process for each of the device types.\n10. Remove any pre-installed SolutionPacks and collectors that you do not plan to use:\n- a. Access the UI at https:// &lt;Frontend-hostname&gt; /APG .\n- b. Type the login credentials. The default username is admin . The default password is changeme .\n- c. Browse to Administration &gt; Config &gt; SolutionPacks &gt; Installed SolutionPacks .\n- d. Click the SolutionPack that you want to uninstall.\n- e. Click the Trashcan icon for each component.\n- f. Click Remove .\n11.

To accomplish this, an NFS Share is required from a NAS Server, exported with Read/Write permissions for each Frontend Server.\n\n- NOTE: The NFS Share should be a minimum of 1 GB and have the abilities to expand at the NAS server. For the average customer environment, 1 GB should be sufficient, but for a larger user environment, you may want to start with a 3 GB or 5 GB NFS file system.\n- NOTE: Dell does not support installing an NFS Server on the Linux vApp VM.\n\nOnce the NFS File System has been established and exported, follow these steps to add the NFS share to Dell SRM.\n\n- NOTE: For the example configuration below, the NFS Share is name SRM-FE-apg-reports-nfs.\n\n## About this task\n\nPreserve the data on the Primary Frontend Server if the SRM is not a new configuration. If this is a new environment, then skip step 1:\n\n## Steps\n\n1. On the Primary Frontend Server, rename the apg-report director to: apg-reports-old\n\n…/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/temp/apg-reports\n\n2. On all the Frontend Servers, edit the /etc/fstab file.\n3. Add this line to the bottom of the fstab file on all Frontend Servers and save:\n\n&lt;nas Ip-Address&gt;:/SRM-FE-apg-reports-nfs /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apg-reports nfs defaults\n\n```\nIppa028:/etc # more fstab Devpts   / dev/ pts          devpts  mode=0620, gid=5  0  0 proc     /proc               proc        defaults      0  0 Sysfs    / sys               sysfs       noauto        0  0 debugfs  /sys/kernel/debug   debugfs   noauto          0  0 Usbfs    /proc/bus/usb       usbfs  noauto             0  0 tmpfs    /run                tmpfs    noauto           0  0 /dev/systemVG/LVRoot / xfs defaults  1  1 /dev/sda1 /boot ext3 defaults  1  2 /dev/mapper/systemVG-Lvswap none swap defaults  0  0 10.247.25.121:/SRM-FE=apg-reports-nfs  /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apg-reports nfs defaults 1  1\n```\n\n4. Create a new directory on /opt/APG ➔ mkdir nfs-shared .\n5. Go to /opt/APG/nfs-shared ➔ mkdir apg-reports.\n6. Cd Change owner ➔ chown -R apg:apg *\n7. Mount the NFS share ➔ mount /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apg-reports.\n8. Go to ➔ /opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/temp.\n9. Delete apg-reports if the directory exists ➔ mkdir apg-reports .\n10. To create a symbolic link ➔ ln -s /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apg-reports.\n11. Verify the symbolic link with ➔ ls -l\n\n```\nIppa028:/opt/APG/nfs-shared # mount /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apg-reports Ippa028:/opt/ APG/nfs-shared # df -h Filesystem                              Size   Used     Avail     Use%     Mounted on rootfs                                  120G   11G       110G       9%       / devtmpfs                                7.9G   100K      7.9G       1%       /dev tmpfs                                   7.9G     0       7.9G       0%       /dev/shm tmpfs                                   7.9G    64K      7.9G       1%       /run tmpfs                                   7.9G    64K      7.9G       1%       /var/run /dev/mapper/ systemVG-LVRoot            120G    11G      110G       9%       / 10.247.25.121:/SRM-FE-apg-reports=nfs  1009M   768K     1008M       1%       /opt/AGP/ nfs-shared/apg-reports Ippa028: /opt/APG/nfs-shared #\n```\n\n```\nIppa028 : / opt/ AEG/ Web-servers/ Tomcat/ Default/ temp # In -s /opt/AEG/nfs-shared/ apg-reports Ippa02E : / opt/ÄPG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/DefauIt/temp # Is -1 total 0\n```\n\n```\ndrwxr-xr-x  2  apg  apg   6 May    4   13:19 apg-mib-browser-1462382370077 Irwxrwxrwx  1  root root  31 May   4   15:50 apg-reports ->  /opt/APG/nfs-shared/apgreports drwxr-xr-x  2  apg  apg   6 May    4   13:18 jna-96792 -rw-r-----  1  apg  apg   0 May    4   09:45  safeToDelete.tmp\n```\n\n12. Go to the apg-report directory ➔ /opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/temp/apg- reports.\n13. Verify that the NFS share has R/W privileges by creating a file from each of the Frontend Servers. You should have a minimum of two test files in the apg-reports folder ➔ touch test-file# .\n14. Verify that these files are seen from each of the Frontend Servers.\n15. On the Primary Frontend Server, go to apg-reports-old.\n\nNow copy the data from the apg-reports-old directory to the NFS Share apg-reports. cp -R * /opt/APG/WebServers/Tomcat/Default/temp/apg-reports\n\n16. Ensure that the files are owned by apg user ➔ chown apg:apg -R *\n17. Remove the test-files ➔ rm test*\n18. After the reports have been copied to the NFS Share, the apg-reports-old directory can be removed with ➔ rm -r /opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/temp/apg-reports-old\n\n```\nIppa 028: /opt/APG/Web-Servers/ Tomcat/ Default/ temp/ apg-reports # Is -als total 24 8 drwxr-xr-x  6  apg   apg   1024 May    4  16:00  . 0 drwxr-xr-x  3  root  root    24 May    4  15:44  . . 8 drwxr-xr-x  2  apg   apg   1024 May    4  15:35 . etc 0 -rw-r--r--  1  apg   ap       0 May    4  15:57 test-file-1 0  -rw-r--r-- 1  apg   apg      0 May    4  15:56 test-file-2 8 drwxr-xr-x  2  apg   apg   1024 May    4  16:00 user-1 0 drwxr-xr-x  2  apg   apg     80 May    4  16:00 user-7\n```\n\n\n## Using the Discovery Wizard\n*Chapter: Reconfiguring the LBC, Generic-SNMP, and GenericRSC*\n*Page: 39*\n\n\nThe Discovery Wizard is a tool to ease the initial deployment and configuration of the most commonly used SolutionPacks. After upgrading to SRM 4.2 or later, you may want to use the Discovery Wizard to quickly enable the SolutionPacks, and add the corresponding devices that you would like to report on. In a few simple steps you can now add the devices, monitor the collection process, and then go to the reports to see the data.\n\n## About this task\n\nThese steps use the VMAX 3/VMAX All Flash SolutionPack as an example.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Log in to the user interface at https://&lt;Frontend-hostname&gt;:58443/APG .\n\nThe default username is admin . The default password is changeme .\n\n2. Access the Discovery Wizard from the admin page: Administration &gt; DISCOVERY &gt; Discovery Wizard .\n3. On the License page, do one of the following and click Continue .\n3. NOTE: To support the XML based license features with SRM, the configuration property must be updated.\n- For more details on configuring the XML license property, see Dell SRM Administrator Guide.\n- You can add a permanent license by drag-and-dropping the file onto the license box.\n4. On the Storage Collection page, do the following and click Continue .\n- a. Type the FQDN or IP address of the Unisphere for VMAX host.\n- b. Type the login credential and port number.\n5. On the Confirm Storage page lists the detected arrays.\n- a. Select the arrays from which you want to collect data.\n\nThe meter at the bottom indicates how many more volumes you can collect before you exceed the limit.\n\n- b. Click Start Collection &amp; Continue when you have finished adding arrays.\n2. NOTE: The Confirm Storage page only applies to VMAX systems.\n6.
