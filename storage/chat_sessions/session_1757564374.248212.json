After all the changes are completed reboot the Primary Frontend Server and the Additional Frontend Server reboot\n2. Verify that the NAS file system is established after a server start up df -h\n3. Log in to the Primary and Additional Frontend Server with a user that has scheduled and stored reports.\n4. Review the OTB reports. Review the user's reports.\n5. Run the import properties task on the Primary Frontend Server and the Additional Frontend Servers.\n6. Test the Scheduling of a report.\n7. Log in with a user that has Global Admin privileges.\n8. Select a UI administration function and ensure that the UI is redirected to the Primary Frontend Server.\n\n<!-- image -->",

From the SRM Administration UI, go to DISCOVERY &gt; SNMP Device Discovery &gt; Snmp-Discovery &gt; Devices , and select the Cisco MDS/Nexus switches from the device list.\n2. From the Actions drop-down list, select Delete .\n3. Click Execute Action , and then click OK .\n4. Click Dashboard in the left pane.\n5. Under Device Distribution , click Distribute all... .\n6. Click Send the generated configurations... .\n\n## Update Capabilities\n\nFor devices discovered through the Cisco MDS collector in Discovery Center, SRM 4.1 introduced a new capability that is called CISCO-DEVICE-ALIAS ([DALIAS]) that enables the discovery of Device Aliases that participate in an Active ZoneSet. SRM 4.3 introduced a new capability that is called CISCO-PORT-CHANNEL-MEMBERS([PCNLMEM]) that enables discovery of port channel members.\n\n## About this task\n\nTo start polling the new capability after upgrading to Dell SRM 5.1.1.0, complete the following procedure:\n\n## Steps\n\n1. From the SRM Admin UI, go to DISCOVERY &gt; Discovery Center &gt; Manage Discovery click the Cisco MDS/Nexus Solution Pack and then click the row for a Cisco switch.\n\nThe Edit Cisco MDS/Nexus window opens.\n\n2. Click Test and Rediscover .\n3. After the Test and Rediscover function completes, click OK .\n4. Repeat these steps for the switches that are discovered in the Discovery Center.\n5. To trigger polling, click Save .\n\n## Brocade Switch Discovery\n\nBeginning with ViPR SRM 4.2, you can discover Brocade switches by using Discovery Center. The advantage of using Discovery Center is that you can discover the switches in a fabric by entering the IP address of one switch in the fabric. In addition, topology and performance polling interval configurations only apply to devices discovered using Discovery Center. If you prefer to go to SNMP device discovery, you can skip this section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- NOTE: Do not trigger SNMP-based switch discovery from both Discovery Center and SNMP Device Discovery. When a switch is discovered from both Discovery Center and SNMP Device Discovery the switch is polled twice, wasting collector resources.\n- NOTE: If the Brocade switches have been moved to the Brocade SP, then skip this section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Export Brocade Switches\n\nExport the Brocade switch details from SNMP Device Discovery.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. From the SRM Admin UI, go to DISCOVERY &gt; SNMP Device Discovery &gt; Snmp- Discovery &gt; Devices .\n2. Select Brocade switches.\n\n3. From the Actions drop-down list, select Export seed file , and click Execute Action .\n\n## Results\n\nThe system saves a file that is named agents.csv to the local machine. The exported seed file consists of both the switch details and credentials. The same exported seed file must be used for importing the switch details and credentials into the respective tables using the Discovery Groups tab in Discovery Center. This seed file will not be imported into the devices UI.",
