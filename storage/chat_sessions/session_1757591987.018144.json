From SRM Administration UI, go to CONFIG &gt; SolutionPacks .\n2. Go to the Browse and Install SolutionPacks and select one for which the SolutionPack block must be installed.\n3. Click Install .\n4. Enter an instance name for the component that is being installed.\n5. Assign a server for the related components. In a typical four server deployment, the recommended server is selected automatically.\n6. Click Next .\n7. Click Install .\n8. When the installation is complete, click OK .\n\n## Next steps\n\nNOTE: VPLEX threshold-based alerts are disabled by default. To manually enable threshold-based alerts, go to CONFIG &gt; Alerts &gt; Manage Alert Definitions &gt; Dell VPLEX Alert Definitions . (SNMP-based alerts are enabled by default.)\n\n## Restore Timeout Values\n\nCustomized timeout values are overwritten with a default value during the upgrade, and the system backs up the XML files that contained customized values.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. On Linux, run the following command on each server to find the files with values that changed:\n2. On Windows, use Windows Explorer on each server to locate the files. After the upgrade, you must manually compare the old files to the new files and restore the values appropriately. com.watch4net.webservice.idle.timeout\n3. NOTE: You can configure the idle time out value using the property. The default value for idle time out is 15 minutes.\n\n```\nfind / -name *old*(year of upgrade)* -print\n```",
