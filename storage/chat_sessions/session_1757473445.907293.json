Update the following lines for `apg` user to change limits from 65534 to 512000:\n   ```\napg hard nofile 512000 apg soft nofile 512000\napg hard nproc 512000 apg soft nproc 512000\n```\n\n3. **Save the File**\n   Save the changes and close the file.\n\n4. **Verify Changes**\n   Type the following command to verify the changes:\n   ```\ngetconf -n APG_NOFILE\ngetconf -n APG_NPROC\n```\n\n5. **Restart Services**\n   To restart services, navigate to the `/opt/APG/bin` directory of the installation and execute the following commands:\n   ```bash\nsu apg -c 'ulimit -n -u' open files (-n) 512000 max user processes (-u) 512000'\n/opt/APG/bin/manage-modules.sh service stop auto\n/opt/APG/bin/manage-modules.sh service start auto\n/opt/APG/bin/manage-modules.sh service status all\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you will have successfully verified and configured the user process limits for the `apg` user account on all VMs to a maximum of 512000.",
