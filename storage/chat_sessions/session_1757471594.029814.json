Download the Dell SRM <version number> vApp Deployment Zip file, and validate its integrity using an MD5 checksum utility.\n\n**Step 3: Deploy OVF Template**\n\nOpen vCenter Client and connect to the vCenter Server that manages the VMware environment.\n\n*   Do not run vCenter Client on a VPN connection.\n*   For the fastest deployment time, the host running vCenter Client should be local to the ESXi servers.\n\n3.  Select where in the vCenter ESXi cluster/server you want to deploy the VMs for Dell SRM.\n4.  Select File > Deploy OVF Template.\n5.  In the Source step, locate the *4VM\\_vApp.ovf* and system.vmdk files.\n6.  Click Next.\n\n7.  In the OVF Template Details step, review the details of the loaded .OVF file, and then click Next.\n8.  In the End User License Agreement step, review the license agreement. Click Accept, and then click Next.\n9.  In the Name and Location step:\n    *   Specify a new name or accept the default name for the appliance.\n    *   Specify an inventory location for the appliance in the VMware environment.\n    *   Click Next.\n\n10. Select the Resource Pool or the folder where the deployment places the Dell SRM VMs, and click Next in the Resource Pool step.\n11. In the Storage step, select the destination storage (DataStore) for the virtual machine files and click Next. The compatibility window states if there is insufficient disk space on the selected DataStore, and a warning is displayed when you click Next.\n\n12. In the Disk Format step, select the storage space provisioning method, and then click Next.\n\n| Option                   | Description                                                                                |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Thin-provisioned format  | On-demand expansion of available storage, which is used for newer data store file systems. |\n| Thick-provisioned format | Appliance storage that is allocated immediately and reserved as a block.                   |\n\n13. In the Network Mapping step, select a destination network for all of the VMs, and then click Next.\n\n    With SRM 4.2 onwards, the only option is to place all 4 VMs on the same ESX server network. It is known as the simplified network deployment.\n14. In the IP Address Allocation step, choose the IP allocation policy and IP protocol to use, and then click Next.\n15. In the Properties step, provide the values for each of the VMs, and then click Next.\n16. In the Ready to Complete step, review the list of properties for the appliance, and then click Finish. A pop-up window opens in vCenter Client showing the deployment progress.\n17. After the 4VM deployment finishes, in the Deployment Completed Successfully dialog box, click Close.\n\n**Post-Deployment Configuration**\n\nBefore powering on the vApp, make the following changes to the VM configurations:\n\n*   To expand the file system, add additional VMDK disks.\n*   Adjust the vCPU and VM Memory as specified in the Dell SRM design.",
