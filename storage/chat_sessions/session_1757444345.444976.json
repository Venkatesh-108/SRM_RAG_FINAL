Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Confirming ESE Listening on Port 9443**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1. To confirm if ESE is listening on port 9443, type the following command:\n   ```\n   SuSE: netstat -ntlp | grep 9443\n   RHEL: lsof -i -P -n | grep 9443\n   ```\n\n**Upgrading Embedded ESE Version**\n---------------------------------\n\n1. After upgrading ESE, on the SRM Admin UI page, go to CONFIG > Settings > Dell Technologies Connectivity and click Test Server Connectivity icon.\n2. **Generate New Access Key/ PIN**: \n    a. Generate new AccessKey/PIN at Dell Product Support.\n3. **Enter New Access Key/PIN**:\n    b. Enter the generated AccessKey/PIN and click Save.\n4. **Verify Connection to Dell Server**: On the SRM Admin UI page, go to CONFIG > Settings > Dell Technologies Connectivity and click Test Server Connectivity icon to verify that connection to Dell server is successful.\n\n**Confirming ESE Version**\n-------------------------\n\n1. After successful connection, to confirm the version of ESE installed, use the following command:\n   ```\n   curl -k -H $'x-dell-auth-key: Afor!@#akhdqwihqiu34344\\_y9yfqiwiwuefi56w3AABweuf' https://localhost:9443/ese/status\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can upgrade the embedded ESE version to the latest on Windows.",
