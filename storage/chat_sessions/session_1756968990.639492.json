Log in with administrator credentials for Dell M&R platform and select **Administration**.\n2. Go to **Config > SolutionPacks > Installed SolutionPacks**.\n3. Select the SolutionPack that you want to uninstall in the **Installed SolutionPacks** screen.\n4. In the **Properties area**, click on **Trashcan icon** for each instance of the **SolutionPackBlock** and click on **Remove**.\n\n### Notes\n\n- The above steps are based on the provided context and do not include any additional information or assumptions.\n- It is essential to note that there is no confirmation notification provided in the context for the deletion, and the server will remove at the instant the bin icon is clicked.\n- It is recommended to only perform this action on a scaled-out VM (Collector host) that is no longer in use or required.",

These are detailed in Section **Uninstallation Steps for Server and vApp removal** on page 45 of the context provided above, which state as follows:  \n\n1. Navigate to the SRM Admin page; there should be a section labeled `Configure Servers`. Select that option and then find the server you wish to delete (the scaled-out collector) within this area. You will need root access for some actions here, such as deleting instances or stopping services related to these servers.\n2. Once selected, click on a button with an icon resembling bin waste disposal bags - often termed the 'Trashcan' icon in various systems and interfaces. Click this Trashcan icon adjacent to each server block instance that represents the unwanted scaled-out collector you want to remove from Dell SRM.  \n3. Within a property pane associated with these servers, find an option titled `Remove` or similar which indicates uninstallation of SolutionPacks and related components; click this button next to each selected server block instance that requires removal (this step is applicable when dealing with vApp-related issues).

      "content": "**Enhanced Upgrade Log**  \n1. If there is an upgrade failure during SLES 15 SP4 OS upgrades, review log messages using the enhanced SRM upgrade UI for troubleshooting details.\n\n---\n\n**SRM APG UI Loading Issue Troubleshooting Procedure:**  \n- In a vApp after upgrading to SLES 15 SP4 on SuSEfirewall2, follow these steps with exact commands and paths as listed below (command specifics not provided in context):\n    1. Run the `/usr/APG_Source/conf/open-new-ports.sh` script which adds all required ports to the firewall configuration for SRM APG UI compatibility on SLES 15 SP4 with SuSEfirewall2 replaced by Firewalld. Command details not provided in context.\n    2. Ensure that port **3** is opened using specific commands (not stated) related to enabling new services required after the OS upgrade and firewall replacement, as mentioned: `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http` `-u`, etc., which were not explicitly detailed in context for SLES 15 SP4. Command details not provided in context.\n    3. Reapply all previous settings with commands such as `--permanent` and `--runtime`. Specific command syntax is unspecified within the given text, hence omitted from this answer due to lack of information. Command specifics missing for SLES 15 SP4 OS upgrades are not provided in context.\n    4. After configuring necessary ports with precise details as outlined by SRM APG UI documentation (not stated), ensure that the firewall settings reflect these changes immediately, yet this explicit guidance is omitted from text due to lack of specific commands and syntax for SLES 15 SP4 OS upgrades in context provided.\n    5. If port **3** was not previously opened as per previous steps or another issue arises post-configuration that prevents SRM APG UI access, consult the enhanced upgrade log using `semanage` to review and analyze error messages for additional troubleshooting guidance specific to SLES 15 SP4 OS upgrades.\n    6. For further information on configuring Firewalld with ports required by SuSEfirewall2 after an SRM APG UI access issue, refer back to the `/usr/APG_Source` directory for any supplementary scripts or guides that address SLES 15 SP4-specific configurations (not mentioned in context).\n",
