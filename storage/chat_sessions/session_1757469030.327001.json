Change the logging level to display fixed links in the daily Tomcat log file.\n\t* Edit the `logging.properties` file at `/opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/conf/logging.properties`\n\t* Set the `level` parameter to `INFO` (default value) or higher\n2. Verify the log entries for fixed links.\n\n**Viewing Log Entries**\n\n1. Expand the \"Log Files\" blue bar.\n2. Download or view a catalina.<date stamp>.log file from the Frontend server logs directory `/opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/logs`\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n* The logging level change only affects the daily Tomcat log file and does not change the behavior of the Broken Links Detection Tool.\n* Fixed links are indicated in the log entries with a percentage confidence value (100% if fixed, 0% or less if not).\n* You can select to apply suggested fixes for broken links, but manual intervention may be required if the suggestion is incorrect.\n\n**Table: Broken Links Description**\n\n| Column        | Description                                 |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Type          | The type of link that is broken.             |\n| Name/Location | The report containing the broken link.        |\n\nNote: This procedure assumes you have basic access to the Frontend server and knowledge of Tomcat configuration files. If you encounter any issues, refer to the Dell SRM documentation or seek assistance from a qualified technical expert.",
