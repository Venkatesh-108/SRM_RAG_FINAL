Go to Admin > Config > Alerts > Manage Alert Definitions.\n2. Select the folder containing the desired alert definitions and click Export Selected Definitions to backup individual definitions or select Alert definitions and click Export All Definitions for all available alerts.\n\nNote: In versions earlier than SRM 4.3, keep a copy of the alerting-contexts.xml from /opt/APG/Backends/Alerting-Backend/conf directory.\n\nIn SRM 4.3.x and later versions, go to Alerting Frontend UI, under Local Manager, click Alert Definitions.\n\nThe backup of threshold values does not require an explicit backup of alert definitions as they are retained after upgrade (no specific page or section is referenced in the context).\n\nTo add an alerting context, right-click the desired alert definition and select Configure Options.",
