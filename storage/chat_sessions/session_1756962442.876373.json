Do not use the **vCenter remove from inventory method**.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n1. Log in to the **vCenter Server** managing the vApp you want to scale out.\n2. Right-click the vApp and select **Shut Down**. Wait for all VMs in the vApp to shut down completely.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. Use the **1VM vApp OVF** option to install a single vApp VM inside the SRM vApp. You can add a single vApp VM (Collector or Additional Backend) to an existing vApp container that was created with the 4VM vApp.\n2. Restart the vApp container, and the new VMs will be automatically configured into Dell SRM.\n\n_Important Note:_ If you need to move the vApp VM/folder from one vCenter to another, you must use the **vCenter export and import procedure**.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* Dell SRM supports adding additional backends and collectors either inside or outside of the SRM vApp.\n* Dell SRM vApps fully support the VM vMotion and Storage vMotion DRS functions within the ESX clusters of vCenter.\n* The Collector host that is deployed with the 1VM is configured with 48 GB of memory and 8 CPUs.\n\nNote: The context does not provide a step-by-step procedure for deploying scaleout VMs in an existing vApp. Therefore, this answer only provides general guidance on the prerequisites and additional information related to this topic.",
