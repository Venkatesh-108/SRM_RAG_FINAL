Go to Admin > Config > Alerts > Manage Alert Definitions.\n2. Select the folder that contains alert definitions you want to backup and click Export Selected Definitions. Alternatively, select \"Alert definitions\" and click Export All Definitions to back up all available alerts.\n\nNote: If the customization to alert definitions is done using only threshold values, then a backup of alert definitions is not required as these value changes are retained after upgrade (Section 3).\n\nSteps:\n1. Go to Admin > Config > Alerts > Manage Alert Definitions.\n2. Select the folder which contains alert definitions that you want to backup and click Export Selected Definitions.\n3. To export all available alerts, select \"Alert definitions\" and then click Export All Definitions.\n\nNote: In versions earlier than SRM 4.3 (Section 6), also keep a copy of the alerting-contexts.xml from /opt/APG/ Backends/Alerting-Backend/conf directory.",
