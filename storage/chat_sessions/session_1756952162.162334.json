Go to Admin > Config > Alerts > Manage Alert Definitions.\n2. Select the folder which contains alert definitions that you want to backup and click Export Selected Definitions. To take a backup of all available alerts, select Alert definitions and then click Export All Definitions.\n\nNote: If the customization is done using only threshold values, then back-up of alert definitions is not required as threshold values are retained after upgrade.\n \nSteps applicable for versions SRM 4.3.x and later:\n\n1. Go to Alerting Frontend UI.\n2. Under Local Manager, click Alert Definitions.\n\nIf you need to export the alerting-contexts.xml file, please refer to the directory locations mentioned in section [Step 3] of the context (versions earlier than SRM 4.3) or follow the steps in version SRM 4.3.x and later.",
