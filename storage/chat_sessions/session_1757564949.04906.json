If the import-properties task completes in under 30 minutes, then use the defaults. If the import-properties task takes 30 minutes or longer to complete, use a 1 hour start time difference for the import-properties task on the Additional Frontend Server task from the Primary Frontend Server task.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNOTE: If there are multiple Additional Frontend Servers, then adjustment of the import-properties Task start time must be staggered so as not to impact the database performance.\n\nThe import-properties task operation could cause a reduced performance of the database servers, especially if the databases are very large and multiple import-properties task instances are running simultaneously. As a consequence, you should edit the import property task and delay the execution of the scripts with respect to each other. The delay must be inserted only if the import tasks take longer than 30 minutes to complete.\n\nEdit the import-properties.task file: …APG/Databases/APG-Property-Store/&lt;instance-name&gt;/conf/importproperties.tas\n\nOn the Primary Frontend Server , this is the default configuration for under 1 hour:\n\n```\n<!-If the average of the last 5 executions takes < 1 hour, schedule at 5:00AM and 12:00PM --> <conditional condition=\"slidingFinishedAverageDuration &lt; 3600000\"> <schedule cron=\"0 5,12 * * *\" xsi:type=\"schedule-repeated\" disabled=\"false\"></schedule> </conditional>\n```\n\nOn the Additional Frontend Server , change the under 1 hour default setting to:\n\n```\n<!-If the average of the last 5 executions takes < 1 hour, schedule at 1:00AM, 6:00AM, 1:00PM, 6:00PM --> <conditional condition=\"slidingFinishedAverageDuration &lt; 3600000\"> <schedule cron=\"1 6,13 * * *\" xsi:type=\"schedule-repeated\" disabled=\"false\"></schedule> </conditional>\n```\n\nOn the Additional Frontend Server , change the under 1 hour default setting to:\n\n```\n<!-If the average of the last 5 executions takes < 1 hour, schedule at 2:00AM, 7:00AM, 2:00PM, 7:00PM --> <conditional condition=\"slidingFinishedAverageDuration &lt; 3600000\"> <schedule cron=\"2 7,14 * * *\" xsi:type=\"schedule-repeated\" disabled=\"false\"></schedule> </conditional>\n```",
