    "## What's New in SRM\n*Chapter: Dell SRM 5.1.1.0 Web Portal Guide*\n*Page: 11*\n\n\nThe SRM frontend URL prompts a pop-up dialog known as New Features once you login. The pop-up dialog lists the new features which are part of current SRM release. You have the option to select Do not display this message again checkbox option in the pop-up dialog, if you do not want to see the dialog again in successive logins.\n\nYou can access the New Features page from the Help section at any time. This feature is available for all User Roles supported by OTB in SRM. The SRM admin can disable this feature based on the User Role from Admin UI &gt; Users &amp; Security &gt; Users &amp; Roles &gt; Manage Roles &gt; [Role] &gt; Modules &amp; Restrictions Access &gt; Watch4net Frontend &gt; New Features dialog display . Admin can control the enabling or disabling of this feature for any user from SRM Admin UI &gt; Users &amp; Security &gt; Users &amp; Roles &gt; Manage Users &gt; User Status .\n\n## Browsing reports\n\nBrowse mode is the default mode of the user interface. In Browse mode, you can generate and view reports by clicking the report nodes in the tree.\n\nYou can do the following in browse mode.\n\n- Examine in most reports to get more detailed reports.\n- Change how reports are displayed, including the type of table or graph that is used to display the data.\n- Customize the look, and feel of the displayed metrics.\n\n- Change the type of aggregation and the type range of the report.\n- Create a dashboard of favorite reports.\n- Take a snapshot of a report.\n- Print, email, and export reports.\n- Schedule reports.\n\n## Navigation styles\n\nThe navigation column on the User Interface provides access to all reports. You can choose between the Icon Navigation and Tree Navigation styles. The Administrator sets the default style for the installation.\n\nDefault style\n\nEach user account can override the global default style and set their own preferred style in the Navigation Style field at Profile &gt; User Settings &gt; Preferences .\n\nIcon Navigation\n\nThe Icon Navigation style helps preserve space on smaller-sized windows. Initially, it shows only a thin column of icons. To browse to a report, click an icon. A second column of categories appears. To expand a category, click it, and click again to select a report. Notice the scrollbar on the expanded second column. The second column disappears when you click a report. To browse further into the reporting structure, use the tabs, dashboards, and links in the reporting pane.\n\nTree Navigation\n\nThe Tree Navigation style can display the entire reporting structure, with multiple nodes expanded at once. Use the arrows to expand or contract the nodes. To display a report, click any entry in the tree. You can also use the tabs, dashboards, and links in the reporting pane to browse around the reporting structure.\n",

    "## Displaying and canceling reports\n*Chapter: Dell SRM 5.1.1.0 Web Portal Guide*\n*Page: 13*\n\n\nWhen you browse to a report on the Console, the system starts generating that report using the most recently collected data. If you browse away from the page to another report, the system cancels the first report and starts generating the new report.\n\nHere are some important hovers over remember about displaying reports.\n\nData collection occurs in scheduled intervals\n\nOne report per user session at a time\n\nScheduled reports generate in the background\n\nReports in Stored Reports are snapshots, and are not regenerated\n\nThere might be many data collectors in the system, each gathering data from different components in the infrastructure. Each collector is configured with a collection interval. Depending on how the administrators configured the various collectors, you might see some infrastructure activity, reflected in reports within 15 minutes, and others not for a day or more.\n\nThe Console generates one report per user session at a time. If you browse to another report while the first report is still generating, the first report is canceled, and the new report generation starts. If you are waiting for a long-running report to generate, do not click around examining other reports expecting the original report to finish running in the background.\n\nScheduled reports do not affect the \"one report per user session\" rule. If you consistently depend on reports that take a long time to generate, you can put those reports on an automatic schedule, and view them in their completed state whenever you need them. Use Tools &gt; Schedule this Report . You can request that the report be emailed or stored on a remote system. You can request that the report be emailed, stored on a remote system, or stored for Console viewing under My Reports &gt; Stored Reports .\n\nWhen you browse to a report in the My Reports &gt; Stored Reports node, the snapshot of data from the stored date/time redisplays. The report is not regenerated. You can store a snapshot using Tools &gt; Store this Report , or schedule the report as mentioned earlier.\n",

This search feature returns an organized set of links to the reports that contain the value. To start a Quick Search, type a search\n\n## Advanced Search\n\nstring in the Search text box in the banner area, and press Enter . The search string must be at least three characters and not contain wildcards.\n\nProvides a filter for defining detailed search conditions and an expansion field for defining what to return and how to organize the results. To start an Advanced Search, click Modifications &gt; Advanced Search .\n\nIn either case, you can view the results in the report window and also in a Search Results node that is created in the report tree.\n\n## Quick search\n\nTo perform a quick search, type the search string in the Search text box in the banner, and press Enter. The search returns links to reports about the found values.\n\n## About this task\n\nNOTE: The search string must contain at least three characters and no wildcards.\n\nThe search is case insensitive, and finds occurrences of the string anywhere in the property value (that is, at the beginning, middle, or end of the value). The result is a categorized list of links to reports that contain the matched value.\n\nFor example, the following search for LGL finds device names containing that value, and returns links to major reports about those devices. In this case, the links are to the device summary reports and to alerts on those devices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe search looks at a limited set of predefined properties in each of the product databases. The following table shows the database properties that are searched.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe categories correspond to databases. The installation might not use all of the databases.\n",

    "## Filtering a report using group filters\n*Chapter: Click Tools &gt; Store this report .*\n*Page: 28*\n\n\nGroup filters appear across the top of the report. They present a dialog box of check boxes that let you select multiple values to filter on.\n\n## About this task\n\nThe dialog box lists only the values that are relevant to the current report. The list reflects the database and is further limited by the report filter in the report definition. For example, the following filter on the Platform property lists only the platforms that are being monitored at the installation and are relevant to the report definition:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote the following information about group filters:\n\n- If there are no values in a filter dialog box, the installation is not populating that property, or no values apply to the current report.\n- In a table report, the values that appear in a group filter dialog box are not limited by column filters that might be in effect on the table. For example, a Situations to Watch report might contain a column filter that eliminates rows that are based on values in that column. In that way, a Situations to Watch report typically contains just a few rows. The group filter dialog box, however, continues to list all values relevant to the entire report, not just to the displayed rows.\n- A group filter can be defined for any database property using features in EDIT MODE.\n- When a group filter is defined on a data enrichment property that is maintained in the Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Groups &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Groups module, the values in the dialog box are the group names as defined under Groups Management. Some groups have predefined names. Other groups define a Default group, and expect each installation to create additional groups.\n- When a group filter is defined on a collected property, the values in the dialog box are the property values from the database.\n\nUse the following procedure to set group filter values.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Click the icon for a group filter. A dialog box of values appears.\n2. Select one or more values to include in the report, and click Apply . The icon for the applied filter changes color to indicate that the filter is active.\n\nThe report redisplays, including only the data for the values you specified in the filter. For example:\n\n- In a table report, the filter eliminates rows from the table.\n- In a consolidated bar chart, the filter eliminates data from the metric calculations.\n3. If multiple filters are available, optionally apply additional filters to further limit the displayed results.\n\n4. To cancel a filter, click the filter icon and select Clear .\n",

When less than 1 week's values are available, only the blue line showing values for the last 24 hours appear on the report. A baseline is fully functional when 4 or more weeks of data are available.\n\nBaselines are useful for interpreting performance metrics.

You can better describe metrics by adding more properties, and even create your own data property names and definitions. Every metric is collected with their own set of properties. The model is unlimited and can be used to describe any object.\n\nDell SRM gathers many types of data from a storage infrastructure, depending on the installed options and SolutionPacks. In general, reports are populated by the following types of data:\n\n- Capacity data provides the status of volume, sizing, and capacity utilization statistics, is considered as a measurement type of data collected, and based on a regular schedule.\n- Performance data provides the instantaneous activity of an indicator, such as throughput rate, response time, IOPS, and CPU usage.\n- Event data is composed of notifications that are received from a managed system. The event data differs in nature from a measurement that is collected at a regular scheduled. Examples of event data include: CPU utilization warning, high memory consumption, and disk running out of space.\n- Metadata is more commonly known as properties. These refer to a set of associated data that is used to define the collected data (Capacity, Performance, and Event). It can refer to the system name, element name, version number, location, and many more.\n\nTo access metric reports:\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Log in to SRM Admin UI.\n2.

Pin the report to a personal view.\n2. Copy and paste a report from the main tree into the My Reports node. Do not use a link if you want to keep your copy separate from the copy in the main report tree.\n\nTo make your changes visible to all users, coordinate with an administrator to prevent multiple users from simultaneously editing the same template. Administrators might have you:\n\n- Edit directly.\n- Copy and paste.\n- Extract the report as a template, add the template to a ReportPack, and hook the ReportPack to nodes in the main report tree. This method provides the best way to control the hooks and manage the tree hierarchy.\n",

Only when the first user is finished editing, saves the changes, and logs out of the session can another user safely edit a report affecting the same template.\n\nThe following permission controls and change management procedures are recommended to avoid potential problems with multiple users affecting the same template:\n\n1. Write access to global report templates should be assigned to a limited number of Administrator users. Assign this limited permission on Administration &gt; Users &amp; Security &gt; Users &amp; Roles &gt; Manage Roles &gt; New Role &gt; Template Access . Most users should have read-only access to templates.\n2. Instruct users to edit reports only under My Reports . It is always safe because the changes are visible to only the current user and templates are not affected. No special permission is required.\n3. Implement an internal change management process for users to submit requests to an Admin requesting changes to the global reports.\n4. Always make a backup of the report tree before you begin making major changes to reports or the report tree outside of the My Reports node.

Because the filter determines the report's dataset, it is a vital part of the overall report configuration. To set the filter correctly, you must know properties and its meaning. The collectors collect these properties. There are several ways to create a filter. If you know what properties and values you want to set, you can manually edit a filter. You can also use the Filter Wizard to help you define a filter.\n\n## Expansion\n\nThe expansion setting is central to how the report tree works. It enables the quick generation of report trees, expanding its branches as it transforms individual nodes into multiple nodes.

The syntax for complex expansions is: property&lt; type=complex expansion type;param1=value1;param2=value2;... &gt; , where the expansion type is a string to identify which complex expansion to use. You cannot use the semicolon (;) or greater than (&gt;) characters in a parameter value.\n",
    "## Combined Regex/Apg Pattern Match (type=sql)\n*Chapter: 3. Press Enter .*\n*Page: 44*\n\n\nBased on a pattern, this expansion uses two typical expressions and transformations to create groups. It is similar to the Dual Regex Pattern Match except that the values are matched in groups using a filter instead of a typical expression. Since this expansion is quicker than the others, use this one whenever possible.\n\nThis expansion uses these parameters:\n\n| value-match        | The first typical expression that is matched against the property values.                                                  |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| value-replace      | The replacement string that is applied to the previously matched values. The result of this replacement is the group name. |\n| group-match        | A typical expression that is matched against the previously generated group names.                                         |\n| group-replace- sql | A replacement string to create a pattern (with % and _ wildcards) to match property values to include in this group.       |\n\nThe expansion occurs in these phases:\n\n- For each distinct property value, tries to match the property value with value-match. If the value matches, then replaces it using the replacement string value-replace. The resulting value creates a node in the tree.\n- For each node created in the first phase, applies a transformation on its name using the typical expression group-match and replacement string group-replace-sql . This transformation creates a valid pattern that is applied to the created node as property='pattern' .\n\nFor example, if there are three devices in a network, the property device is expanded in three values: dev-w4n-montreal, router-w4n-montreal, server-w4n-toronto. To use the location to group devices, do the following:\n\n- Create location groups from the device names with this expression: ^.*-w4n-(.*)$ → $1\n- To match the groups montreal and toronto, use a matching device. A matching device is a device whose name ends with the group name, which is the city name in this example. For the montreal group, the matching filter is 'device=%montreal' .\n- The expansion result is: device&lt;type=sql;value-match=^.*-w4n-(.*)$;value-replace=$1;groupmatch=^(.*)$;group-replace-sql=%-$1&gt;\n",
    "## Regex Pattern Match (type=regex)\n*Chapter: 3. Press Enter .*\n*Page: 44*\n\n\nThis expansion type is a simplified version of the two previous types. Most of the time, the values that are used to create group names belong to those groups, and only to those groups. This is what the Regex Pattern Match does, skipping the post matching phases of the Dual Regex Pattern Match and the Combined Regex/Pattern Match.\n\nThis expansion uses these parameters:\n\n| value-match   | The first typical expression that is matched against the property values.                                                  |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| value-replace | The replacement string that is applied to the previously matched values.

This transformation creates a third typical expression.\n- Rematches any property value with this typical expression. It works similar to a filter. The group node selects it if the value matches.\n\nFor example, if there are three devices in a network, the property device is expanded into three values: dev-w4n-montreal, router-w4n-montreal, and server-w4n-toronto. To use the location name to group these devices, do the following:\n\n- Create location groups from the device names with this expression: ^.*-w4n-(.*)$ → $1\n- To match the groups montreal and toronto, use a matching device. A matching device is a device whose name ends with the group name, which is the city name in this example. For the montreal group, the matching typical expression is ^.*-montreal$ .\n- To match a device in a group, build the previous typical expression from the group name with this replacement: ^(.*)$ → .*-\\\\Q$1\\\\E\n- The result is this expansion: device&lt;type=dual-regex;value-match=^.*-w4n-(.*)$;valuereplace=$1;group-match=^(.*)$;group-replace-regex=.*-\\\\Q$1\\\\E&gt;\n",

A relation stores one or several object names, such as a device name, in another object's property, such as the remote system property.\n\nThis expansion uses these parameters:\n\n| value-separator     | The character that is used to separate entries in the targeted property.                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| property- separator | The character that is used to separate properties when values contain multiple entries.                                                                                                         |\n| properties          | The name of the properties. The split operation extracts the values of these properties. You can use multiple occurrences if more than one property must be identified in the generated filter. |\n| level-up            | Parent nodes to be skipped in the construction of the node's filter.                                                                                                                            |\n| name-override       | You can use a specific name for the created node.                                                                                                                                               |\n\nIn this example, the collected data includes the property peerifs that identifies peer interfaces. It contains a list of device-part pairs that is expressed similar to this: peerifs='device1,part1;device1,part2;device2,part1'\n\nTo create a node for each distinct device-part pair and associate a filter to each node that selects the correct data: device=='device1' &amp; part=='part1' . The result is: peerifs&lt;type=split;value-separator=~;;propertyseparator=,;properties=device;properties=part;level-up=5&gt;\n\nYou can use the tilde ( ~ ) character to escape the semi-column when it is the targeted character to split values or properties. If you want the filter to contain multiple parts, you can use the properties parameter several times. If not overridden by the name-override parameter, the name of the resulting node is the name of the matched value.\n\nIn this example, you can use the split expansion to void the filtering effect of parent nodes. This is useful when the filter is incompatible with the data you want to report on. For example, to report on interface utilization ( parttype='Interface' ) of devices with a Filesystem ( parttype='Filesystem' ), split on a property, create the filter using the same property, and use the level-up parameter to void the effect of the selection filter: device&lt;type=split;properties=device;level-up=1&gt; .\n",
    "## Hide expansion (type=hide)\n*Chapter: 3. Press Enter .*\n*Page: 46*\n\n\nThis expansion is used to prevent a property from being displayed when expanding on multiple properties.\n\nFor example, if you want to expand a node on device,deviceid because you have some hosts sharing the same device property. Deviceid is used to prevent hosts with the same device property from being merged into a single node, but the deviceid property is a long text string that you do not want to have displayed. By using the hide expansion ( device,deviceid&lt;type=hide&gt; ), the expansion works as it normally does only the deviceid is not displayed.\n\nExample of hosts without using the hide expansion:\n\n- example-host1, afekru23417\n- example-host2, fdg98713424\n- example-host3, dsfhng32442\n- example-host3,dfsanl123412\n- example-host4,134wf343244\n\nExample of hosts using the hide expansion:\n\n- example-host1\n- example-host2\n- example-host3\n- example-host3\n- example-host4\n",

For example, if a few sibling nodes select the same IP address, the Other node selects all the other IP addresses. If there is no expansion, there is no distinction between the Edit and Browse node filters. Use this setting in most cases. If there is an expansion, this setting returns the unmatched results of the sibling filters as they appear in Edit mode. This differs from how the resulting node filters are expressed in Browse mode, and provides different results. |\n| For the resulting browse node filter | Use this setting when using the Top N for the events property to select a reduced set of results in the expansion, or when doing complex expansions that result in a partial list of results. In both cases, the unmatched results are evaluated against the filters of the expanded nodes in Browse mode, resulting in all variables that are not chosen by any expanded nodes. In both cases, the results are subject to any parent node filters. You can use filters on these other variables that the node with the unmatched option selects.                                                    |\n\n## Report Display Preference\n\nYou can use a stored report instead of creating a report that takes a considerable amount of time to generate.\n\n| Use Real Time Values   | The report is generated on-the-fly.                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prefer Stored Report   | When you click the report node, the most recent and available stored report appears.

You select the report type on the Report Configuration in Edit Mode tab. You can also select the report type in Display Mode through settings icon in each report.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. In Display Mode , indicate how you want multiple reports to appear on the report page.\n\nThe default behavior displays one report after another report.\n\n2. In Report Type , click the layout to use for the report.\n\nThe report types are divided into the following categories:\n\n- Tables\n- Graphs\n- Aggregated\n- TopN\n- Misc\n- Mixed\n\nWithin a report category, all the report details are the same. This means that you can change the Report Type to another one in the same category and the report settings remain applicable. After you save the settings, the report details are saved from session to session, even if you switch to another report type.\n\n3. In Report Rendering , select the type of rendering to apply to the report.\n4. In Default Duration , specify the time range to display on the report.\n5.

    "## Report configuration parameters\n*Chapter: 7. Click Save .*\n*Page: 53*\n\n\nYou set the type, the time period, the rendering, the aggregation, and the description of a report on the Report Configuration tab. You can also use the advanced settings of Report Configuration tab to define the time zone and indicate whether to use dynamic maintenance periods.\n\n## Display Mode\n\nIndicate how to place multiple reports on the report page for viewing. The default behavior displays one report after another report. You can also manually rearrange reports on a page.\n\n## Report Type\n\nSelect which report type to use for displaying metrics on this node.\n\n## Report Rendering\n\nSelect the rendering to apply on the report, including any displayed sub-report.\n\nDynamic rendering is available on standard charts and provides better zooming and analyzing tools than the static one. However, it can have a performance impact if enabled on many reports simultaneously.\n\n## Default Duration\n\nSelect the time range to display on the report. Sometimes, this time range is not taken into account. For example, if the report is using a formula where the duration is explicitly selected, this default value is bypassed. You can exclude time periods from the report by clicking the calendar icon.\n\n## Sampling Period\n\nThe aggregate interval to use to gather data from the database. You can also configure the report to use aligned data for one of the aggregates.\n\n## Sampling Type\n\nThe aggregation to use to gather data from the database.

Click Save .*\n*Page: 54*\n\n\nEnable the temporal settings of the current report to use for all child reports when drilling down to them from the report in the page area. The settings are:\n\n- Default Duration\n- Sampling Period\n- Sampling Time\n\n## Report Description\n\nThis description displays at the top of a report. You can use XHTML in &lt;div&gt; tags in the description.\n\n## Displayed Properties\n\nThese properties display at the top of the report, which includes the contact name and location. The default name of the property can appear in its title, which displays in the gray text box.\n\nAlways use this setting when the report is for a single device because only one value appears for each added property.\n\n## Time Zone\n\nSpecify the time zone for a report generated on the current node. Inherit means that the time zone is inherited from the parent node. If there is no parent, the report uses the time zone from the profile of the current user.\n\nThe first field indicates whether the report uses universal time, the default, or whether the time period is aligned. Universal time indicates that the time period corresponds to the report's time zone in the adjacent list, and the data shown in the report is relative to its time zone. For example, selecting the last hour of data displays data from the current time, which is 10:00 America/Montreal time, and appears along the x-axis, back to 9:00 America/Montreal time. If you are monitoring a device in Montreal, you can see its activity data between 9:00 to 10:00. If you are also monitoring devices in Paris at this time, the activity data is between 3:00 and 4:00 AM Europe/Paris.\n\nThe other effect of universal time is that daily and weekly aggregates are delineated on UTC time. For example, the daily aggregation period for America/Montreal is from 18:00 - 19:00 whereas the Montreal time zone offset is UTC - 5 hours.\n",
    "## Align data on UTC using tz property with the following reference\n*Chapter: 7. Click Save .*\n*Page: 54*\n\n\nThis setting time shifts the data from different time zones to align them. The setting aligns data in order for the time zone to be independent in the report. Aligned data displays using aligned aggregates.\n\nThe effects of aligned time zone aggregates are:\n\n- Data from different time zones is time-shifted to a universal day where data is expressed according to the local time zone where the data was recorded. For example, data at 9:00 locally is aligned with data at 9:00 at a remote time zone. Data can then be compared at each time zone in relation to how users experience it during a typical day or week. Without using aligned aggregates, data from different time zones is expressed in relation to the local time zone of the report.\n- For aligned daily and weekly aggregates, days and weeks are delineated according to 24 hour 7 day periods where time zones are aligned. Without using aligned aggregates, days and weeks are delineated according to UTC.\n\nWhen you use aligned data, the second time zone list sets the reference. This is important when choosing data from the last day. If the data is aligned and America/Montreal is the reference point, and it is 13:00 in Montreal and you display the last day of information, the data returned is from 13:00 today to 13:00 yesterday. If you choose Europe/Paris as the reference, and it is\n\n19:00 in Paris, the last day extends the report from 19:00 on the current day to 19:00 yesterday and there will not be information in the report for the last 6 hours in Montreal because it has not occurred yet in the day where the time zones are aligned.\n\nReference is important if time zones occur on different days. The day the report covers is determined by the reference time zone.\n\nFor this functionality to be available, it must be configured in the backend and the frontend. Whether there are daily and weekly aligned aggregates is determined in the backend setup. For aligned aggregates of one hour or less, the frontend computes them on the fly on a best effort basis if aligned time zones are enabled. Some aggregates are not generated: the local time of the aggregate must be a number of whole hours offset from UTC for the one hour aligned aggregate to be computed. Locations with an additional half-hour offset such as Asia/Kolkata (UTC +5:30), are not computed.\n\nYou are not explicitly informed whether time zone aligned aggregates are available, but in most cases, if Align data on UTC using tz property with the following reference is available in the first time zone list, aligned time zone aggregates are available for each sampling period.\n\nThese constraints apply to aligned data:\n\n- Maintenance periods configured in the interface appear in graphs but not used for computations or in tables. If you configure a maintenance period from 8 to 9, this period is highlighted in the graph, and pertains to 8 to 9 in all time zones, as the data is aligned.\n- Do not use the Outage Editor with aligned data as the results are inaccurate.\n- Do not plot events on the same graphs as aligned data with an Overlay, as the results are inaccurate. Events cannot be aligned across time zones as time series data can.\n",

For example, if you are reporting on a month or year, selecting a day or week aggregate instead of real-time dramatically increases the report generation speed. It is important because with such long ranges, such detail is not typically required. The period selection option is related to the sampling period. It is because the application can automatically select a higher aggregate than the one selected when it really fits the report time-range. It provides better performance and scales no matter the report time range. When you unable to change the specified aggregate, always choose this option. However, it can trigger a high report generation time if the report time range is too wide. NOTE: When you select a small sampling period, such as real-time, allow for the selection of higher periods for better performance. |\n| Sampling Type                          | Selects one of the available aggregated values that are stored in the database.

A column is defined based on an Attribute, a Property, a Value, an Aggregate of other columns, or a Combined cell of other columns. For more information about adding and configuring columns, see Table report parameters.\n\nThe following parameters control the look of the item report, after you have defined the columns.\n\n| Item Alignment   | Defines whether the item report (all items in the report) is aligned to the left margin, centered, or right margin of the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Design Map       | Defines which columns to include in the item report, and where to position each column. Drag a column from the unpositioned section to the desired location in the design map. Sections in the design map can hold multiple columns. Click the Tools icon that is associated with a column to access the column formatting parameters. |\n\n## Graph reports\n\nYou can add more graphing information or precision to any graph report, including standard, aggregated, and baseline graph reports.\n\nGraph reports plot variables along the X (time) and Y (value) axes. Depending on the graph type, metrics can come from the current node or from the children nodes. You can use time series graphs that display multiple metrics that are related to a data selection or events that show only one series of values per event series.\n\nThere are value and baseline graphs that are available on every node of the tree, although baseline graphs require more than one week of data. Value graphs are generated using the properties of a selected node and its filter.\n\nGraph reports can also have two y-axes, with two different sets of metrics plotted against them.\n",

This includes standard and aggregated graph reports, and the baseline report.\n\n## Main Y-Axis Boundaries\n\nYou can set up y-axis fixed bounds for the report to automatically focus on a relevant data range. This is useful when the acceptable values of the range are already known, such as availability data.\n",
    "## Main Y-Axis Scaling Mode\n*Chapter: 7. Click Save .*\n*Page: 86*\n\n\nYou can scale the values on the y-axis. If the values are too high or too low to be meaningful, you can multiply or divide by a factor that produces a meaningful number. You can also choose by-unit and select the required conversion using the offered choices. The Binary scale, such as KiB and MiB, uses 1024 as the scaling factor, and is typically used for computer memory. The Decimal scale, such as KB and MB, uses 1000, and is typically used in storage. Classic was created for the old interpretation of the multipliers where K = 1024.\n\n## Thresholds Definition\n\nCritical and major thresholds appear in the graph only if you give them values. You can add as many thresholds as necessary, giving each a different value and color. If there is a second y-axis in the graph, the thresholds you set are applicable only to the main y-axis.\n\nThresholds have a different meaning for Time Ratio Bar Graphs. For these graphs, thresholds define the intervals for computing the time ratios and the colors of the bars. For example, two thresholds actually define three intervals. The first interval gathers all values below or equal to the lowest threshold. The second interval retrieves all the values above the first and below or equal to the second. The last interval gathers all the values above the second threshold. The unit marked next to the input box tells you how to enter the threshold definitions.\n",

Current choices for icons are: circle, square, triangle, inverted triangle, and pentagon. ● Size - Defines the column that determines the size of the icon for each child node. This column can be of any type and must contain a numeric value. You can use attribute, properties, or values that exist, or you can create a new one. The size is calculated as a ratio between the node's value and the minimum and maximum value of the other nodes. These minimum and maximum values can be overwritten if the theoretical min and max are known, such as for a percentage. To override them, type values in the Minimum and Maximum boxes. For example: Assume that you are mapping two devices for which the CurrentUtilization metric determines the size. Device-1 has a CurrentUtilization of 10 percent, while Device-2 has a CurrentUtilization of 13 percent. If the min and max boxes are empty, the maximum value is 13 and the minimum value is 10. Therefore, Device-2 has an icon with the maximum size (64x64 pixels) while Device-1 has the smallest icon possible (16x16 pixels). However, since these values can use a percentage, set the maximum to 100 and the minimum to 0 to ensure the icons for Device-1 and Device-2 are almost the same size, showing a realistic representation. ● Color - Defines the column that determines the color of the icon for each child node. It is a value column and |\n\n## Displayed Information\n\nFor information about these settings, see Table report parameters.\n\n## Related concepts\n\nReport Details tabs Table report parameters Graph report parameters\n\nTopN report parameters Heat Map report parameters Treemap report parameters External report address Topology report parameters Overlay report parameters Status report parameters\n\n## Heat map reports\n\nA heat map report displays metrics in colors in a two-dimensional grid. You group metrics together and set the thresholds to color code the range of values for hot and cold areas. For example, red can indicate a severe problem and a lighter shade of red can indicate a warning.\n\nYou can group any combination of metric properties to define the axes of the grid. You can aggregate these metrics over time for one or both axes. The produced heat map report displays the aggregated values according to the specified time unit, which can be an hour, day, week, month, or year.\n\nIn Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the heat map report from the aggregated section.\n",
    "## Heat Map report parameters\n*Chapter: Match metrics using a*\n*Page: 82*\n\n\nYou set how you want information presented in a heat map on the Report Details: Heat Map tab.\n\n## Axes Configuration\n\nSelect one of the following expansion types for each axis.\n\n- Select use report expansion to expand the axis using the parameters that are specified for the report on the Report Configuration tab. The ordering on the axis is defined by the Order field.\n- Select use time expansion to build a heat map that displays the evolution of variables based on a unit of time (for example, a day, a week, and a month). If you select this value, the Sampling Period and Over fields appear. For example, you can expand an axis to show a Sampling Period of every day over some time period, such as a week or a year.\n\nIf the report duration is 1 year and the x-axis time range is for each 1 day over 1 week, each heatmap value is an aggregate (such as an average, minimum, or maximum) of all values of each time period included in the report duration.\n\n## Scaling Mode\n\nIf the unit of the values does not correspond to what you want to display, this field provides a way to convert the values. Select one of the following:\n\n- none does not convert values.\n- multiply multiplies all values by the decimal value you supply in the by field that appears when you make this selection.\n- divide divides all values by the decimal value you supply in the by field that appears when you make this selection.\n- by unit converts the existing unit values into new unit values without requiring you to provide the formula. For example, using selections from the drop-down lists that appear, you can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, or Packets per second into KPkts per second (or MPkts, GPkts, or TPkts per second). Explore the drop-down lists to see all the supported conversions.\n\n## Order\n\nDefines how to order rows and columns in the heat map when the axes configurations are use report expansion . See the tooltip next to the field for explanations of each option.\n\n## Show Grid\n\nWhen selected, draws a border around the heat map cells.\n\n## Use Gradient Color\n\nWhen selected, inserts gradient colors on the heat map cells that are between the closest thresholds.\n\n## Thresholds Definition\n\nThresholds do not appear in the report unless you give them values. You can add as many thresholds as necessary, giving each a different value and color. If there is a second y-axis in the graph, the thresholds you set here are applicable only to the main y-axis.\n\n## Properties in Legend\n\nThese properties display in the graph's legend to identify the variables. To select the properties to appear in the legend, click Edit Properties . To reorder their appearance in the legend, hover the cursor over a row and drag it to the required position.\n\n## Tooltip Information\n\nChoose properties to add to the tooltips that appear when a user hovers the cursor over a location in the report. The additional information is added in the form of a description followed by the property values. For example:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo select properties, click Add Property .\n\n- Type the database property name, such as device , or click the property selector icon for help.\n- Choose the description to appear on the first line.\n- default uses the system-provided description for the property. For example, Device name is supplied for the device property.\n- none does not use a description.\n- custom lets you supply a phrase.\n\n## Related concepts\n\nReport Details tabs\n\nTable report parameters Graph report parameters TopN report parameters Map report parameters Treemap report parameters External report address Topology report parameters Overlay report parameters Status report parameters\n\n## Treemap reports\n\nA treemap report displays metrics in a hierarchy using size and color. Based on the tree hierarchy, each branch is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles to represent the metric aggregation from each child node.\n\nIn Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the treemap report from the aggregated section.\n\n## Treemap report parameters\n\nYou define how to present information on a treemap report on the Report Details: Treemap tab.\n\n## Number of Levels\n\nSets the depth of the report. You can select up to three levels. For example, to create a global report showing the total capacity of arrays, pools, and LUNs, set this level to three. To report on the total capacity for arrays and pools only, set this level to two.\n\n## Size\n\nThese settings determine the area size of the cells for the lower nodes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Column Name     | A unique name that appears in the table header.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Selected Value  | Retrieves a value from the following: ● filter allows the configuration of a specific filter, which selects the metrics to display from the child. ● property value lets you specify a property.

The report definition defines the value being measured, the upper and lower bounds of the gauge, and optional thresholds for identifying severity.\n\nIn the following gauge, the boundaries are defined as -1 and 1. The current measurement is 0.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThreshold that is defined on the measured value can change the color of the gauge. For example, a green gauge indicates that the current value falls within the defined range for Normal, whereas a red gauge indicates a Critical value, according to the defined thresholds.\n\n## Gauge report parameters\n\nThe Report Details: Gauge tab defines the metric to measure, its lower and upper bounds, and threshold ranges.\n\n## Value\n\nThis section defines the metric value that the gauge is reporting.\n\n## Table 21.

Adjusting this option can significantly reduce report generation time. For example, if you are reporting on a month or year, selecting a day or week aggregate instead of real-time dramatically increases the report generation speed. It is important because with such long ranges, such detail is not typically required. The period selection option is related to the sampling period. It is because the application can automatically select a higher aggregate than the one selected when it really fits the report time-range. It provides better performance and scales no matter the report time range. When you are unable to change the specified aggregate, always choose this option. However, it can trigger a high report generation time if the report time range is too wide.

    "## Topology report parameters\n*Chapter: @{ attribute } values*\n*Page: 89*\n\n\nOverlay report parameters\n\nStatus report parameters\n\n## Topology reports\n\nA topology report displays a graphical representation of the devices within a network and how they are linked together.\n\nYou can build and display transactions graphically in a topology report. You can use this report to represent a specific section of a network and to display various data between the different elements within a section. It enables you to represent different pieces of equipment and services and the various metrics and key performance indicators linking them together.\n\nIn Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the topology report from the miscellaneous section.\n\n## Report elements\n\nNodes and edges define a topology report. The nodes represent the different elements of a transaction or the various elements of a topology representing a network section. The edges define the relationships between the nodes. A node can have either none, one, or multiple edges linking to other nodes (n-to-n relationship). The edges are capped with an arrow, pointing from one node to another to represent the flow.\n\nAll elements in the report are plotted on a surface that is called a canvas. The canvas has a rectangular shape and consists of tiles that are called cells. A node can only be one cell and a cell can only have one node.\n\n## Layers\n\nLayers and map types are collections of nodes and connections between nodes that present a specific view, such as a physical connectivity view or a logical connectivity view. The difference is that you can select multiple layers to be simultaneously displayed for a report, but you can display only one map type for a report at any time.\n\nDisplay layers through the Layers panel and display a map type with the Map Type drop-down list. This list is only visible in topology maps that have been defined to use layers.\n\n## Overlays\n\nAn overlay is a defined subset of visual indicators, such as bullets, images, spark lines, and color, that provides additional information about nodes and connections in a network. For example, overlays might be defined to inform users about availability, performance, and health. A user can manually display or hide an overlay by selecting or clearing it in the Layers and Overlays menu on the topology map.\n\n## Hop Count\n\nThe hop count is the number of devices that data must pass through from a source to a destination. Topology maps can be defined to display the Increase Hop Count , Decrease Hop Count , and Reset Hop Count icons that enable the number of elements being displayed to increase or decrease according to the number hops selected. The hop icons are not displayed in topology maps that have not been defined to support the feature.\n\n## Topology report parameters\n\nYou define the source and layout of the report on the Report Details: Topology tab. An administrator must configure topology reports before you can set the source and layout for a report.\n\n## Mode\n\nThe mode of the topology report determines the source of the report. It is fully customizable.\n\n| Simple   | Displays the instances of classes from the selected topology that meet the report filter. For example, if you select Router as the class, and the instances in the class are R1, R2, and R3 and the report filter is devtype==\"Router\" and device==\"R1\"; only the R1 router appears in the report.   |\n|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Advanced | Use the Filter setting to restrict nodes to the report filters. It does not apply to the root nodes because they are the starting point of the graph. The root nodes are always restricted to the report filter.                                                                                     |\n\n|                  | For example, if you use this configuration and the report filter is devtype=='Switch', and you do not click the Filter checkbox, the hosts appear in the report, although they do not meet the report filter. All switches, which are determined by the report filter and linked to the hosts in the topology, appear in the report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Drilldown        | Renders a report based on the sub-reports of the current report. If the current report has three sub-reports, then three nodes appear. The node is based on the sub-report in Browse mode. Each node is clickable to Drilldown to the sub-reports. For drawing the nodes, you need a template containing the images references. If there is not a template or if the template does not contain references to the sub-report, the interface uses the sub-reports icon. Drilldown mode displays reports that are one level below the topology report to prohibit edges from displaying. |\n| Custom           | The topology custom mode report is configured in XML files. You must place the XML file in the topomap directory of the WebApps-Resources module. For example, <APG>/Custom/WebApps- Resources/Default/topomap .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Topology Service | Uses the Topology service to generate the nodes and relationships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n## Topology\n\nSelect a topology service that is configured for the frontend application. These are set in the web application's dedicated XML configuration (for example, in /opt/APG/Web-Servers/Tomcat/Default/conf/Catalina/localhost/APG.xml on UNIX or in C:\\Program Files\\APG\\Web-Servers\\Tomcat\\Default\\conf\\Catalina\\localhost\\APG.xml on Windows.)\n\n## XML data retrieval\n\nThis defines how the XML describing the report is retrieved. In each case (file path or URL), dynamic values can be injected at runtime by using placeholders. To inject a property, use ${property}. For example: http://www.company.com/query? mydevice=${device}. For topology map services that support it, \"hop-count\" and \"map-type\" can also be specified with their default values, using @{hop-count[:default-value]} or @{map-type[:default-value]}. For example: http://www.company.com/ query?hopcount=@{hop-count:1}&amp;maplayer=@{map-type}.\n\n## Layout\n\nUse this setting to determine the layout of the report.\n\n| Organic      | Positions the nodes based on a physics simulation of the interacting forces.   |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Balloon      | Positions the child nodes radially around their parents.                       |\n| Circular     | Positions the nodes in a circle.                                               |\n| Hierarchical | Positions the nodes in a hierarchical structure.                               |\n| Tree         | Positions the nodes in a tree structure with the parents at the top right.     |\n| Manual       | This setting is only available in custom mode.                                 |\n| Orthogonal   | Positions the nodes at right angles.                                           |\n\n## Template\n\nUse this setting to determine how the nodes and edges are drawn. For the simple and advanced modes, the id-ref of each node is the same as the class. For Drilldown mode, the id-ref is the sub-report in Edit mode. For example, if you have a sub-report named \"Router\" and you perform an expansion on it, then each node of this expansion has the id-ref set to \"Router.\"\n\nIf you select more than one template and the same node is located in multiple templates, only one is valid.\n\nFor the edge part of the simple and advanced mode, the id-ref is formatted as Source.Relation. Destination.\n\n## Overlays\n\n## Name\n\nAssign a name for the overlay. The name appears on a menu of layers and overlays that are displayed on each Topology report.\n\n## Display\n",
    "# Templates\n\n\nThe value visible causes the overlay to be displayed by default on the Topology report. The value that is hidden causes the overlay to be hidden by default.\n\nUse the pencil icon to display a list of templates. Select the template in which overlays are defined.\n\n## Related concepts\n\nReport Details tabs Table report parameters Graph report parameters TopN report parameters Map report parameters Heat Map report parameters Treemap report parameters External report address Overlay report parameters Status report parameters\n\n## Overlay reports\n\nOverlay reports define additional layers to a graph report where events are plotted. You define the events to appear in a graph in a table report.\n\nAn overlay report is a mixed report because it displays the child graph report and the child table report on the same page.\n\nIn Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the overlay report from the mixed section.\n\n## Configuration process\n\nTo configure an overlay report, do the following:\n\n1. Add an overlay report node to the tree and configure it.\n2. Configure a graph report as its child.\n3. Configure a table report as its child, setting the events to appear in the graph.\n\n## Overlay report parameters\n\nYou define the selection filter, the tooltip information, and the event attributes on the Report Details: Overlay tab.\n\n## Display Title\n\nThe title does not appear in the reports but appears in the title of the overlay configuration box.\n\n## Selection Filter\n\nFilters events from the selected ones in the child table to appear in the overlay. This filter only contains additional properties because the table performs most of the filtering.\n\n## Boundaries\n\nDefines the zone in the graph where the events appear. It shows boundaries as percentages where zero is the bottom of the graph and 100 is the top. Use negative numbers to position the event zone below the graph. Use the slider for adjustments. Your selection appears with the overlay title at the top of its configuration box.\n\n## Number of Lines\n\nThe number of lines to show the events in the graph. You can use one line per 10% of height. The result is alternating lines that are distributed vertically to plot the events.\n\n## Main Color\n\nThe color value to use for the background of the whole zone. Set to white, #ffffff , to disable it.\n\n## Display Level\n\nEvents and time series are rendered on top of one another. This setting determines how to arrange events and time series in an overlay. To draw overlays under the graph lines, use a negative value. To order different overlays, use numbers for the respective display levels to arrange them from the lowest value to the highest value. You can also use top or bottom as shortcuts for min and max. If multiple overlays overlap, you can choose the order in which they appear, as they are drawn from the lowest value to the highest.\n\n## Display Mode\n\nThe way to render events. Depending on your selection, settings for events with duration are toggled to display those applicable to lines, dots, or areas.\n\nNOTE:\n\n## Event Limit\n\nThe maximum number of events that are displayed in the overlay. Events are displayed using the table order, and after the limit is reached, the rest of the events are not displayed.\n\n## Tooltip Title\n\nThe name of the property whose value is the tooltip title.\n\n## Events Color\n\nThe HTML color code for momentary events.\n\n## Point Size\n\nThe size of the points for momentary events.\n\n## Marker Type\n\nThe type of marker for momentary events.\n\n## Events Color\n\nThe HTML color code for durable events.\n\n## Line Width\n\nThe line width for events with duration.\n\n## Line Style\n\nThe line style for events with duration.\n\n## Dot Size\n\nThe size of the dots for durable dot type events.\n\n## Start Marker\n\nThe marker for the start of events with duration.\n\n## End Marker\n\nThe end marker for events with duration.\n\nIn Display Mode , when Dot is selected, the child table report will not be available.\n\n## Marker Type\n\nThe type of marker for dot type durable events.\n\n## Related concepts\n\nReport Details tabs Table report parameters Graph report parameters TopN report parameters Map report parameters Heat Map report parameters Treemap report parameters External report address Topology report parameters Status report parameters\n\n## Status reports\n\nA status report aggregates data for each child node using a selected function over a time period. Each child node displays as a color symbol that can show its aggregated value and node name. It enables you to quickly view the status of nodes in relationship to one another, such as their average CPU utilization.\n\nYou select the size and symbol to use for the child nodes as well as the thresholds and their colors.\n\nIn Report Type on the Report Configuration tab, you select the status report from the aggregated section.\n\n## Status report parameters\n\nYou set how you want information presented in a status report on the Report Details: Status tab .\n\n## Marker Type\n\nSets the size and symbol to use when reporting on the child nodes. The size values are:\n\n| Nano   | Generates a high-density color-coded status report that is similar to a heat map. It shows the aggregated value and node name in a tooltip. This is the smallest size for a symbol.   |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Micro  | Generates a high-density color-coded status report that is similar to a heat map. It shows the aggregated value and node name in a tooltip.                                           |\n| Small  | Generates a color-coded status report with small status symbols, each displaying its aggregated value and node name.                                                                  |\n| Medium | Generates a color-coded status report with medium status symbols, each displaying its aggregated value and node name.                                                                 |\n| Large  | Generates a color-coded status report with large status symbols, each displaying its aggregated value and node name.                                                                  |\n\n## Show Value\n\nIndicates whether to display the aggregated value inside the symbol and whether to round this value.\n\n## Scaling Mode\n\nIf the unit of the values does not correspond to what you want to display, select multiply or divide from this list. In the corresponding field, you can then type the factor to apply, which allows you to change from bytes to kilobytes, for example.\n\n## Order\n\nIndicates whether to show the child nodes in ascending or descending order.\n\n## Top N Mode\n\nDefines whether to display all the status symbols in a report or a certain number that you specify here.\n\n## Thresholds Definition\n\nThresholds do not appear in the report unless you give them values. You can add as many thresholds as necessary, giving each a different value and color. If there is a second y-axis in the graph, the thresholds you set here are applicable only to the main y-axis.\n\n## Tooltip Information\n\nTooltips appear when the user hovers the cursor over a status icon. A tooltip displays one or more property values and, optionally, property names. You specify the properties that appear.\n\nClick Add to add a new property to the tooltips. Two fields appear.\n\n- In the first field, type a database property name or click the property selection helper and select a property from the list.\n- In the second field, specify the label to appear with the value in the tooltip.\n\n| Default   | Uses the system default name, as shown in the property selection helper .   |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| None      | Does not use a label.                                                       |\n| Custom    | Lets you supply the label.                                                  |\n\n## Related concepts\n\nReport Details tabs Table report parameters Graph report parameters TopN report parameters Map report parameters Heat Map report parameters Treemap report parameters External report address Topology report parameters Overlay report parameters\n\n## Using threshold definitions\n\nSetting a threshold enables you to visually see when a value has exceeded a threshold in a report.\n\nThreshold definitions can be used in almost all report types. With thresholds, you can set a threshold value and assign it a color to represent that threshold. You can define as many thresholds as you need.\n\nIn typical graphs, thresholds appear as dotted lines at the defined values and with the corresponding colors, along with an explanation of each threshold in the legend so you can gauge values that have crossed your defined threshold. In graphs where there is a second y-axis, the thresholds only apply to the main y-axis.\n\nIn tables, status tree map reports, and heat map reports, values that fall within a severity range appear in the selected color or display the related severity icon.\n\nThresholds define the value of the lower boundary of a severity range. The higher boundary of the range is defined by the next highest threshold value. Inclusion of the boundary values in the range is based on severity of the range. The highest severity always wins the boundary value.\n\nYou can define ascending (higher value is more critical) severity, descending (lower value is more critical) severity, or a combination of both ascending and descending severities, as shown in the following examples:\n\n## Example 1: As a value increases, the severity increases\n\nSuppose that you want to set the following thresholds for a CPU utilization value:\n\n- Normal for any value less than 20% utilization\n\n- Minor for any value equal to or greater than 20% and less than 50% utilization\n- Major for any value equal to or greater than 50% and less than 80% utilization\n- Critical for any value equal to or greater than 80% utilization\n\nThe thresholds would be set as follows:\n\n- Normal : -Infinity\n\n- Minor : 20\n\n- Major : 50\n\n- Critical : 80\n\n## Example 2: As a value decreases, the severity increases\n\nSuppose that you want to set the following thresholds for a free space on disk value:\n\n- Critical for any value equal to or less than 20 GB\n- Major for any value greater than 20 GB and less than or equal to 30 GB\n- Minor for any value greater than 30 GB and less than or equal to 80 GB\n- Normal for any value equal to or greater than 80 GB\n\nThe thresholds would be set as follows:\n\n- Critical : -Infinity\n- Major : 20\n- Minor : 30\n- Normal : 80\n\n## Example 3: As a value increases or decreases too much, the severity increases\n\nSuppose that you want to set the following thresholds for a packet jitter value (which can be positive or negative):\n\n- Unknown for any value less than -30 ms\n- Critical for any value equal to or greater than -30 ms and less than -15 ms\n- Major for any value equal to or greater than -15 ms and less than -10 ms\n- Minor for any value equal to or greater than -10 ms and less than -5 ms\n- Normal for any value equal to or greater than -5 ms and less than 5 ms\n- Minor for any value equal to or greater than 5 ms and less than 10 ms\n- Major for any value equal to or greater than 10 ms and less than 15 ms\n- Critical for any value equal to or greater than 15 ms and less than 30 ms\n- Unknown for any value greater than 30 ms\n\nThe thresholds would be set as follows:\n\n- Unknown : -Infinity\n\n- Critical : -30\n\n- Major : -15\n\n- Minor : -10\n\n- Normal : -5\n\n- Minor : 5\n\n- Major : 10\n\n- Criticial : 15\n\n- Unknown : 30\n\n## Example 4: Using a Custom severity\n\nA standard severity has a fixed level. In increasing order (from lower to higher), the highest severity always gains the range border values:\n\n- Undefined\n- Normal\n- Informational\n- Unknown\n\n- Minor\n- Major\n- Critical\n\nFor example, if you have the following threshold definitions:\n\n- Major : -Infinity\n\n- Minor : 0\n\n- Critical : 10\n\nThen the following ranges are defined:\n\n- Major : -Infinity &lt;= value &lt;=0\n\n- Minor : 0 &lt; value &lt; 10\n\n- Critical : 10 &lt;= value\n\nThe range that has the Minor severity does not own the values 0 and 10 because the Minor severity is less than Major (which owns 0) and Critical (which owns 10).\n\nUnlike a standard severity, a Custom severity is not fixed, it is the same as the severity of the range that is defined before it (in terms of value range). For example, if you have the following thresholds set in a table:\n\n- Major\n- : -Infinity\n- Minor\n\n: 0\n\n- Custom : 5\n- Major : 10\n\nThen the following ranges are defined:\n\n- ●\n\n- Major : -Infinity &lt;= value &lt;= 0\n\n- Minor : 0 &lt; value &lt; 5\n\n- Custom : 5 &lt;= value &lt; 10\n\n- Major : 10 &lt;= value\n\nThe Custom range has the same severity level as the one set in the range defined before it (Minor). This is why the range using the Custom severity \"owns\" value 5 but not value 10 (which is owned by a range which has a higher severity: Major).\n\nMixing standard and Custom thresholds is not recommended.\n\nIf you use only Custom severities in all ranges, the behavior is constant because the actual severities are the same. For example, suppose the following thresholds are defined:\n\n- Custom 1 : -Infinity\n- Custom 2 : 0\n- Custom 3 : 100\n\nThen the following ranges that are defined:\n\n- Custom 1 : -Infinity &lt;= value &lt; 0\n- Custom 2 : 0 &lt;= value &lt; 100\n- Custom 3 : 100 &lt;= value\n\nIf you define ranges with increasing severity:\n\n- Normal : -Infinity\n\n- Minor : 0\n\n- Major : 100\n\n- Critical : 1000\n\nThen the following ranges are defined:\n\n- Normal : -Infinity &lt;= value &lt; 0\n- Minor : 0 &lt;= value &lt; 100\n- Major : 100 &lt;= value &lt; 1000\n- Critical : 1000 &lt;= value\n\nIf you define ranges with decreasing severity:\n\n- Critical : -Infinity\n\n- Major : 0\n\n- Minor : 100\n\n- Normal : 1000\n\nThen the following ranges are defined:\n\n- Critical : -Infinity &lt; value &lt;= 0\n- Major : 0 &lt; value &lt;= 100\n- Minor : 100 &lt; value &lt;= 1000\n- Normal : 1000 &lt; value\n\nThe highest severity always wins the border value.\n\n## Related tasks\n\n\n## Sections in this chapter:\n- Setting threshold definitions in tables Setting threshold definitions in graphs Scrollable table\n- Workflow for creating reports Filtering and expansion tab Report Configuration tab Report Details tabs\n- Setting\n- UI interactivity and table interactivity tabs\n- Enable multi-row selection and action menu\n- Report settings\n- Query and variable selection\n- Accessing reports from outside of the Console\n- The base URL is: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/?param=value&amp;param=value\n- The URL to display reports on a full page is: https://[APGserverIP:port#]/APG/report.jsp? param=value&amp;param=value\n- Customizing user settings and custom reports\n- Modifying your user data and password\n- Setting the reporting preferences\n- Setting the first report to appear after login\n- Saving the report tree\n- Import a report definition\n- Find and Fix Broken Links in Reports\n",

All formulas have at least one result, and each result has additional options for displaying them in different contexts.\n\nWhere you use formulas depends on the type of report and the hierarchy of its nodes. When applying a formula to a node, you can plot its result on a graph, insert it into another formula, pass it to another report node, display it in child-based parent report, and display it in a value column in a table on a parent node.\n\nResults can vary when applying formulas to nodes that are subject to an expansion. Depending on the formula type, the aggregation of input parameters from child nodes in a formula can apply to their parent node. You can then view the results in the parent node as an aggregation of the results that are returned by the child nodes.\n\nBy using the report editing tools, you can copy formulas from one report to another report.\n\n## Handling formula results\n\nThe way that you apply formulas depends on how you want to process the results:\n\n- If you want to plot the results of a formula on a simple chart or bar chart for a node, you can apply the formula to the node.\n- If you want to use the results of a formula in a table report, apply the formula to a child of the parent table report node.\n- You can use formula results from the current node or direct children as parameter inputs on the current node. It lets you add several formulas to a node whose results are combined.\n- If you want to use the results of a formula in any child-based report, such as a child-based chart or stacked bars, apply the formula to a child of the node of one of these report types.\n- If you want to pass the results of a child node to a parent of the current node, you can apply a formula to the current node. You can apply formulas to nodes in a hierarchy to pass the results further up the tree until you can access them at the desired node level.\n\n## Related concepts\n",

Click the color patch in a location where a custom color is supported.\n\nThe color map appears.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2. Slide the arrows on the color bar to choose the color family.\n3. Drag the white circle to a location on the color map to fine-tune the color within the family.\n\nYou can also use the code designations to define the color if you know them.\n\n4. Click Apply .\n5. To reuse a defined custom color in another definition, copy the HEX color code in the # field and paste the value into the same field in the new definition.\n",

    "## Find and Fix Broken Links in Reports\n*Chapter: Templates*\n*Page: 109*\n\n\nThe Broken Links Detection Tool scans the entire report tree and identifies all report links that cannot be resolved. It fixes links if possible and provides best guess suggestions for resolving others.\n\n## About this task\n",
    "# Reasons for broken links\n\n\n## Fixing broken links\n\n## Steps\n\n1.\n\nOn\n\nAPG\n\npage, click\n\nAs reports are moved, removed, updated, or disabled in the report tree, links to those reports from other reports must be changed. The old links no longer work. Also, pregenerated reports and reports in the My Reports node, such as pinned reports, scheduled reports, and favorite reports are based on links that might be broken when reports are moved, removed, or disabled. Changed UIDs result in breaking links to reports that were linked or hooked to the original UIDs. SolutionPack upgrades that include moved or updated reports can impact links. For this reason, whenever a SolutionPack upgrade occurs, the upgrade process schedules the Broken Links Detection Tool to run after a timed waiting period. If you are sequencing multiple SolutionPack upgrades closely together, the waiting period is moved out with each upgrade, so that the Broken Links Detection Tool runs only once after all the upgrades seem to be finished. You can run the Broken Links Detection Tool on demand at any time.\n\nThe tool fixes many broken lines during its execution. These links are known with 100% certainty to be remapped to other locations. The tool does not show the automatically fixed links. If you are interested in viewing them, you can change the logging level of the daily Tomcat log file. For suggested fixes that do not rate a 100% confidence, the tool presents you with the pathname of the broken link, a suggested path for fixing the link that is based on certain assumptions, and a confidence percentage for how accurate the suggestion might be. You can select whether you want to apply the suggested fix, and the tool applies the fix. If you believe that the suggestion is incorrect, or if there is no suggestion that is provided, you must manually fix the link. The following procedure describes how to run the tool and how to resolve the detected broken links that were not fixed automatically by the tool.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProfile\n\n2. Click Custom Reports tab.\n3. In the Broken Links Detection section, click Open Tool .\n\nThis button launches the Broken Links Detection task. The task runs on the entire report tree.

The 100% confidence rating occurs when changes match those that are recorded in the mapping files that are installed with the tool. ● When Confidence is not 100%, the value is based on how many components in the broken URL were mapped to known new values or new values that are similar to the original. ● The lowest level confidence suggestions are based on similar node names to the original path, and similar depths of levels in the hierarchy. Check the suggestion carefully to ensure it is correct, and if not, fix the link manually. ● A 0 level confidence rating indicates that the tool could not find any similar report path to suggest. The old and new report path names are too different from each other to be matched. A manual fix is required. |\n\n4. Analyze the suggestion in each row.\n5. To accept a suggestion, click the box in the first column.\n6. Click Apply Fixes .\n7. When a suggestion is not correct or when there is no suggestion at all, manually fix the link as follows:\n- a. Click the Go To icon in the Name/Location column.\n- b. Use any of the following suggestions to manually correct the link path:\n- For Scheduled Reports, Pinned Reports, and Favorites, it is easiest to re-create the link using the User Interface, and delete the outdated report.\n- Correct a link manually: Click Modifications &gt; Edit Reports , and change either the incorrect UID or the incorrect report path in the report definition. There are various places in a report definition where a link to another report might occur. Save the change, and return to Browse Mode.\n- If there are many reports linking to the same report path, and that report path is not being found, causing many failures for the same reason, consider the following approach: Revert to the previous version, add a UID to the report that is not being found, then upgrade, add the same UID into the report definitions in the new location, and run the tool again. Analyze whether this advanced approach is better than correcting each link manually.\n8. Rerun the Link Detection Tool.\n9. Repeat these steps until all broken links are fixed.\n",

    "## Managing users and user rights\n*Chapter: Reasons for broken links*\n*Page: 118*\n\n\nA global administrator can assign access rights to users and groups to control what they can see and do in the interface.\n\n## Roles\n\nRoles group users together to help you manage access to reports, modules, and functionality, such as report editing and report searching. You can also assign administrative tasks to a role.\n\nYou assign a user to a role when creating or modifying a user account or a role. There are several default roles that you can use and you can create your own roles. You can assign a user to one or more roles.\n\nIf you do not assign a user to a role, the user only sees the Scheduled Reports, Stored Reports, and Favorite Reports branches in the report tree.\n\n## Inheritance of privileges\n\nYou can define a parent-child relationship in which one role inherits the privileges of another role. In this relationship, the child role uses the parent access rights and restrictions for viewing reports and components and using functionality.\n\n## Primary filter\n\nA primary file provides you an additional layer to manage access to metrics shown on reports. You can set up a primary filter to restrict the users of a role from viewing certain metrics on reports.\n\nYou can also define a primary filter for a particular user, which is combined with the group's primary filter to place more viewing restrictions on that user.\n\n## Profiles\n\nA user contains personal information, such as login credentials. You associate a user with a profile to define the global characteristics of a user, such as language and time zone. Users are automatically assigned to the default profile, but you can add profiles according to your company's global reporting requirements.\n\n## Advanced mode\n\nYou perform most user management functions in standard mode. However, to establish inheritance between roles, assign administration tasks to a role, and reset default roles to their original settings, you must use advanced mode.\n\n## User Management\n\nA user account and associated password are required to log in the system. A user account can be shared, and multiple online sessions can log in with the same account simultaneously.\n\nThe User Management page lists all user accounts, their status, their profile, whether the profile is enabled, and some optional information about the user, such as name and email address. From this page, you can add new user accounts and edit existing user accounts.\n\nThe User Management page also lists the number of days left for password expiry as well as the last accessed date of the user.\n",

    "## Registering additional servers\n*Chapter: Uploading a &lt;ReportPack&gt;.arp file*\n*Page: 132*\n\n\nThis topic describes how to register remote servers using SRM Admin UI.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThe additional server must be installed.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Click Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Settings .\n2. Click Configure Servers .\n3. Click Register a Server .\n4. Type the following server details:\n\n- Server HostName - links the server to a device in the APG database. To get historical data for the device, Dell Technologies recommends using the same name that is used by APG, which is the server hostname. You can confirm it by looking at APG Health reports in the Frontend. Server HostName is also used as the server display name if you do not create an alias.\n- Server Alias - customizes the server display name in Admin UI without any other impact. If you do not create a Server Alias, the hostname is used.\n- Server Description - is displayed on the Centralized Management home page in the Physical Overview under each server name. It can be left blank or used to describe a server role.\n- WS Gateway URL - contains the URL that points to the remote WebService Gateway. The default configuration is: https://server.name.or.ip:48443/. The WebService Gateway service must be running on the remote server for this to be working.\n- WS Gateway Username - is the one from the Gateway credentials. It is configured at its level, and described in its own documentation. Default value is Admin.\n- WS Gateway Password - is the one from the Gateway credentials. It is configured at its level, and described in its own documentation. Default value is changeme. On an already configured server, Password field is never displayed again. There is no need to fill it before saving: if left blank, it is removed, but rather left untouched. The only means to empty a saved password is to empty the username as well.\n- SSL Validation - can be checked to validate the SSL certification before instantiating communication. When using a self-signed certificate, it should be left cleared. When using a certificate recognized by a certificate authority, it should be checked.\n- Operating System - are used to select the packages to send and use on this server. Be sure to set it to the correct value, as setting it to a wrong value causes invalid or corrupted installations.\n- Health Values - optional, configures the type of data that are recovered and displayed for this server. Real-time data is collected through the APG Self-Monitoring Collector which provides real-time access to the server metrics. Historical data is retrieved from the usual APG databases and is also based on the metrics that are collected by that collector. Databases are defined in the web application context file. See the section on page 61. The physical overview displays historical data if it is enabled. The per-server view displays real-time data if it is enabled, and if not it falls back to historical data. If it is disabled, charts are hidden.\n- Report in Dell M&amp;R - optional, can be used as a shortcut to access a report in the APG frontend. Type the targeted URL and this creates a link to it in the global physical overview. For example, http://apg.server.name.or.ip:58080/APG/ #0-4-52664238.\n- Server Tags - adds the ability to specify string tags for servers. Tags provide useful information about a server that helps to select the recommended server for installing a SolutionPack component. For example, a server tag could be the last part of the ID of a SolutionPack component, such as \"collect.\" A SolutionPack component with the ID emc-vnx-collect would be installed on a server with the tag \"collect.\"\n",

The status column can have multiple values depending on both the service properties and its current state:\n\n- Started - the service is currently running.\n- Stopped - the service has been stopped.\n- Not installed - the service has been removed and is no longer available.\n- Unknown - the current status cannot be determined. This is usually caused by a service that requires administrative privileges to run, such as the Collector Manager when you use the ICMP Collector on UNIX.\n\nIf the Start , Stop , and Restart buttons are not available, the service cannot be managed through Centralized Management UI.\n\n- No button visible - occurs on a service that needs to be running to access the server; as a consequence, it cannot be started, stopped, or restarted. You must manually connect to the server using SSH or a remote desktop to perform these operations, for example the Webservices Gateway module.\n- All buttons are grayed - Centralized Management UI does not have enough rights to perform operations on this service. This can apply to any service that requires administration privileges, such as the Collector Manager when running the ICMP Collector.\n- Only a restart button - this occurs when looking at the Tomcat server that is used to run Centralized Management UI. The restart command is available, but if it were to fail, you must manually connect to the server to fix the issue.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Click Administration .\n2.

For example, a collector or filter configuration that is used in a collector manager, is accessible only on the corresponding collector or filter page. The configuration files table only displays the files that are identified by the module as configuration files.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Click Administration .\n2. Use the Home and select server in the Physical Overview to browse to the module, service, or task whose configuration file you want to access.\n3. Expand the Configuration Files block.\n4. Click the pencil icon to open the configuration file.\n5. Edit the file. Be careful when making changes. The configuration file is not checked to ensure that the changes you make are valid.\n6. Click Save .\n\nThe file gets updated on the server.\n\n## Viewing log files\n\nLog files are useful to check on a module that has recently been started or to track down a specific error that has occurred.\n\n## About this task\n\nLog files are listed in the order of the last modification, so you usually want to review the first file in the table. The number of files is defined in the logging configuration file, which is called logging.properties.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Click Administration &gt; Sytem Admin &gt; Log &amp; Diagnostics .\n2.

There is no confirmation and the task is immediately canceled.\n- Run now button. You can start execution immediately, rather than wait for the next scheduled run.\n\n## Package management\n",
    "## Using Manage Packages, you can manage how packages are used when installing or updating modules.\n*Chapter: Uploading a &lt;ReportPack&gt;.arp file*\n*Page: 135*\n\n\nA package is a module that is frozen at a certain code version. Packages are used to determine when new versions of modules are available and to install and update module instances. Modules are components of the core software, such as: backends, web servers, collectors (XML Collector, and SNMP Collector), and filters (Property Tagging Filter, and Cross-Referencing filter). Modules can be installed and managed separately. When a module is installed, that instance of the module has a unique instance name so that it can operate separately from other instances of the same module. By default, the name of a module instance is \"Default.\" You can manage the installed packages at CONFIG &gt; Settings &gt; Manage Packages .\n\nThe Packages Listing displays the package names, versions, and operating systems. Operating system is important as it determines whether the package can be installed on a particular server or not. You can hover over the Status column to see where packages are installed. You can install a package multiple times on the same server.\n\n## Package synchronization\n\nPackages can be retrieved, cleaned up remotely, or discarded from the Manage Packages repository, which by default is located at Packages Listing.\n\nSynchronization has the following options:\n\n- Retrieve the last packages - connects to each server and fetches the latest version of their packages. It is the easiest way to install new packages as it runs the installer and then runs the synchronization.\n- Retrieve all the packages - retrieves every available package from the servers, not just the latest ones. It is useful if you need a version that is not the most recent one.\n- Remove remote packages - performs a cleanup of the remote servers. For each server, every package that is not installed on it is removed from its repository to free the disk space on the server.\n- Remove old versions from repository - performs a cleanup on the Centralized Management UI package repository and keeps the most recent version of each package, and the versions that are currently installed on the remote servers.\n\nA summary is displayed for each server with the count of globally added or removed packages and the file size. For example, on the central repository, adding two packages and removing five packages results in a count of negative three packages.\n\n## License management\n\nUsing License Management you can add, delete, and check for expired licenses.\n\nLicenses are linked to a host.\n\nNOTE:\n\nFor using XML license management, refer Admin guide.\n",

For more information about scheduled tasks, see Dell SRM Admin Guide.\n\n## Groups Management\n\nGroups Management is a data enrichment interface. It provides a quick way to add additional properties to collected records.\n\nThe Groups Management UI lets you create values for a preconfigured property. You also create the match rules (called membership rules in the UI) that filter collected records to of assign the new value to the matching records. For example, in the Customer group, you can create a Customer value and then create the rules defining which collected records should be enriched with the new value.\n\nPredefined groups are installed with SolutionPacks that use them. For example, any of the SolutionPacks that support LUN service level tagging l install the Service Level by LUNs group. If none of the corresponding SolutionPacks are installed, you cannot see that group in your Groups Management node.\n\nEach group is defined in a configuration file. These configuration files are used to specify the key-properties and new-properties for the Property-Tagging-Filter, the type of group (flat or hierarchical), and the properties to display in the Groups Management preview table. An advanced user can create a configuration file to create a group under the Groups Management node.\n",
    "## Flat and hierarchical groups\n*Chapter: Uploading a &lt;ReportPack&gt;.arp file*\n*Page: 145*\n\n\nA group type is either flat or hierarchical.\n\n## Flat groups\n\nIn flat groups, collected data can match only one rule and the property being added can have only one value per matched database entry. The Service Levels by LUNs is an example of a flat group. The Service Level for a particular LUN can be gold or platinum, but not both. The Service Level property ( psvclvl ) can store only one value.\n\nIn a flat group type, the group names appear in a simple list. The order of the group names is important. The matching is performed in the order of the groups that are listed, and the first match wins.\n\n## Hierarchical groups\n\nIn hierarchical groups, collected data can match one or more rules. As a consequence, the new property can store one or more values. These values are separated by pipes (|).\n\nPlatform is an example of a hierarchical group type. A particular device can match the rules for All Hosts and also for UNIX Hosts. Therefore, the stored property value could be \"All Hosts|unix\" .\n\n- NOTE: A subgroup does not inherit the rules from its parent. The underlying rules must be constructed correctly to support the hierarchy.\n\nThe ordering of the rules does not matter in a hierarchical group.\n\n## Summary of groups\n\nThe Groups Management UI supports a predefined set of group types, each with a predefined purpose. It is important to use and populate each group type according to its intended purpose.\n\nThe following table contains a high-level description and intended purpose for each of the group types that the Groups Management UI supports. Each group type tags collected data with one or more additional properties.\n\nNOTE: The installation might not contain all these group types. SolutionPacks install them since they are using it.\n",

    "## Use the preview table\n*Chapter: Uploading a &lt;ReportPack&gt;.arp file*\n*Page: 148*\n\n\nThe preview table shows the members of a selected group and some additional information about the members.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Chargeback &amp; Service Levels &gt; Block Chargeback Grouping &gt; group\\_type . The page opens with the preview table showing the first 10 members of the first group on the page.\n2. To see more members, use the Show entries drop-down box to adjust the number of entries displayed.\n3. In cases where there are potentially many members, search for specific members using the Search text box. Type an exact value for any of the columns in the table, or use the * wildcard for a partial value search. The search operates\n\non any of the columns in the preview table.\n\nFor example, the search in the following figure ( PowerEdge* ) finds the members of the All Hypervisors group that match a device model starting with PowerEdge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe wildcard can appear anywhere in the search phrase. For example, the search in the following figure ( *lss* ) finds all entries with the character sequence of lss anywhere in a value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4. To preview another group, click to select the wanted group name.\n\n## Create a group\n\nThe Create action creates a property value and specifies the match rules for when that value is tagged to collected data.\n\n## About this task\n\nFollowing is a general procedure for creating a group. Some group types, because of their intended purpose, have logical restrictions on the membership rules. For these and other limitations, see the individual group descriptions.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Groups &gt; group\\_type .\n2. In a hierarchical group type, click the parent under which you want the new group to appear.\n3. NOTE: This step does not apply to flat groups.\n3. Click Create .\n4. In the first text field, type the new group property value. For example, to create a Customer value, type the Customer name. It is the value that is added to tagged records.\n5. If additional text boxes are displayed for additional properties, type those values.\n\nFor example, the service level groups display the Cost per GB field.\n\n6. For flat or hierarchical groups, add dynamic rules to define the records that are tagged with the new property values.\n2. NOTE: For flat groups, dynamic rules are the only way to add members. For hierarchical groups, the UI shows tabs for Dynamic Members and Static Members . Click Dynamic Members .\n\nA dynamic member definition consists of one rule or multiple rules ANDed together to create a rule set. You can , or multiple rules sets to create a detailed filter.\n\nThe following steps provide guidelines for creating dynamic rules.\n\n- a. From the drop-down list, choose Select a property .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThen do either of the following:\n\n- Select one of the suggested property descriptions. The actual property name is automatically provided in the next text box. For example, if you select Device type , the property name devtype appears in the text box.\n- Select Advanced , and then provide a database property name in the next text box.\n- b. In the second drop-down list, select an operation. To use wildcards in the value, select Wildcard .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- c. In the last text box, provide the property value.\n\nTo see suggested values that are based on the property that is named in the first text box, click the box. The suggestions are obtained from existing discovered values in the infrastructure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- d. To AND another rule, click Add Rule inside the ruleset box.\n- e. To OR another ruleset, click Add new ruleset outside of the existing ruleset box.\n- f. To verify defined membership, click Show Members .\n7. For hierarchical groups, optionally add static members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatic members are ones that you select from a list and manually add to the membership.\n\nNOTE:\n\nStatic and dynamic members are combined to create the total membership for a group.\n\n- a. Click the Static Members tab.\n- b. To populate the preview table, make selections from the Type or Source Group drop-down lists. It creates a subset of items to choose from.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- c. To add a static member to the group, select a row in the preview table and click Add to group . The selection moves to the static member list.\n\n8. Click Save .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Edit a group\n\nTo change the membership rules for the group or change the new property values that are associated with the group, edit a group.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags &gt; Manage Groups &gt; group\\_type .\n2. In the right pane, select the group to edit by clicking it.\n3. Click Edit .\n4. Change the property values in the text boxes at the top of the page, if needed.\n5. Change or add to the membership rules, as needed.\n6. Click Save .\n\n## Results\n\nIf you change a group name, all new tagging after the change uses the new group name. Regarding existing records in the database:\n\n- The old group name is overridden by the new group name, if you change only the group name, the change is applied the next time the PTF process runs.\n- You see both the old and new names in reports for a while, if you change both the group name and the rule definition, until the old group name ages out of the reports.\n",

The first group name whose rules match the collected data is assigned. Ensure to order the groups so the most restrictive groups are first.\n\nFor example, in the list of service level groups, System Resource and Pool Contributor identify specialized storage uses. After that, Platinum rules are most restrictive. At the bottom of the list, Other is general and acts as the catchall group when no other rules match.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steps\n\n1.

To access the data enrichment page, select the data enrichment root node from the tree or select the data enrichment node that is located under the physical node.\n\nThe collector manager and/or the event-processing manager must be running to tag data and there must be at least one property tagging filter (for the collector manager) and one event property tagger (for the event processing manager).\n\nThe tagging status provides an indication of how the module is running:\n\n- Running - the module is running.\n- Module is not running - the module is not running.\n- Server not reachable - the target server might be down.\n- WS not Supported - the module is running but cannot get a response from the webservice. The module might be too old and does not support the web service.\n- Unknown - any other errors.\n\nTo add a new property tagging filter or a new event property tagger to the list of tagging, click Register a new module and select a server, category, and the modules to register.\n\nThe Data Enrichment page cannot be used to modify property tagging filters or event property tagger configurations that contain an accessor.\n\nValues that are not correctly written in the property tagging filter or event property tagger datafile appear in red italics.

    "## Using the Data Enrichment UI\n*Chapter: CSV data input file*\n*Page: 158*\n\n\nUse the data enrichment GUI to create the properties and define the rules for tagging data with the property values.\n\nHere is the sequence of tasks that are required to add a property, populate it, verify it, and make it visible in a report.\n",
    "## 6. Add the new property to a report\n*Chapter: CSV data input file*\n*Page: 169*\n\n\n## Register a Collector Manager\n\nTo enable a PTF to run, you must associate it, or register it, to a Collector Manager.\n\n## About this task\n\nTo associate a data enrichment PTF to a Collector Manager, you register the Collector Manager.\n\nTypically, a collector server hosts many Collector Managers. Typically, you want all collectors to use the same PTF to consistently tag data and populate the new properties. A best practice is to register a single module, the CollectorManager :: Load-Balancer :: DataEnrichment module, to minimize overhead and ensure that the same set of tagging rules is used on all data that are processed on a collector server.\n\nIf there is a reason to use different sets of rules for different Collector Managers, you can register each Collector Manager separately, and associate different tagging rulesets to each one.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Log in to the Console and go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags .\n2. Click the Manage Data Enrichment tab.\n3. In the right pane, click Register a new module .\n4. In the Servers column, select the server that hosts the data collecting module that you want to register. Typically, select the Collector server. However, other server types also host a few collecting modules.\n5. In the Categories column, select Collecting .\n6. In the Modules column, select one or more modules that you want to participate in the property tagging. For typical applications, choose Collector-Manager :: Load-Balancer :: DataEnrichment\n\n.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- NOTE: The list shows only running modules. If the wanted module is not in the list, exit and check the status of the Collector Manager under Administration &gt; Home &gt; Physical Overview &gt; server\\_name &gt; collector\\_manager\\_name . Use the Start or Restart buttons on the page if needed.\n7. Click Register .\n\nThe Data Enrichment page redisplays, and the newly registered module appears in the table. You can now associate property tagging rules to the module.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Create new tagging structure\n\nTo match against and the new properties to add, define the new tagging structure by defining the keys.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Log in to the Console and go to Administration &gt; Config &gt; Group &amp; Tags .\n2. Click the Manage Data Enrichment tab.\n3. Click a row for a registered module.\n\nThe tagging page appears.\n\nThis page contains a blue bar for each defined tag set.\n\nNOTE: Dell SRM is installed with a predefined tag set named global-enrichment .\n\n4. (Optional) Click the global-enrichment entry to expand it.\n\nExamine the structure of this predefined tagging structure as a preview to the next few steps. Notice the following:\n\n- This tagging structure contains one key, device .\n- It contains four possible properties to add to records when a collected device value matches a rule.\n- To populate the tagging structure, you would create rows in the table that specify the collected device values to match and the resulting four property values to add.\n- The bunit , customer, and location properties can also be managed using the Groups Management interface.\n5. To go with defining a new ruleset structure, click New tagging . A new blue bar appears, with input fields for defining the new tag set.\n6. For Name , create a unique name for the new tag set.\n- This name becomes the name of the CSV input file containing the rules that you define in the tag set.\n7. To define a key for the structure, click Add new key and complete the details in the dialog box.\n- a. For New column , start typing the APG database field name that you want to match on, and select the field from the list.\n- b. For after , select the position of this new key in the key set. (For the first key, the position must be first .)\n- c. For Default value , optionally type a default value for this field.\n\nType field in the next step specifies the value format. Default value is used as follows:\n\n- A first record is created that uses all the default values.\n- If you add a key into an existing structure that was already populated with records, the default value is used in all the existing records.\n- d. For Type , select the type of match value to use for this field when populating the ruleset.\n\nThe following table provides guidelines for choosing an appropriate type.

You can create custom alert definitions.\n\nAn alert definition contains the following components:\n\n- An entry point filter defines which events are handled by this alert definition. The filter operates on the fields (properties) in the event data. The filter identifies events by matching values in data fields, such as a MIB name and field, or a collector name and metric, or an event name and device type.\n- Operations and conditions are optional components in an alert definition. Operations provide a way to change the metric data in an event. Conditions test the data and provide alternate outcomes for different actions.\n- Actions define what should occur as a result of the event, such as an email, logging file entry, sending HTTP/HTTPS request, SNMP trap to an Events database, or traps to other applications. Only events that are written to the Events database appear in the alerting reports.\n\n## Access alert definitions\n\nYou can configure and enable or disable alert definitions. You can also view a graphical representation of the alert definition, modify it (such as add or remove actions or change the filter), and add new alert definitions.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Click Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Alerts &gt; Manage Alert Definitions\n2. Expand the alert definition folders until the alert definition name appears. In the right pane, the Type column indicates whether the entries are folders or alert definition names.\n3. In the table in the right pane, right-click an alert definition, and choose one of the following actions.\n4. NOTE: If you click (as opposed to right-click) an alert definition, the UI invokes either the Edit or Configure action, depending on the last choice you made using the right-click menu.\n4. To set the default action ( Configure or Edit ) for the current session when you click an alert definition, select the required option one time on the right-click menu.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Alert definition folder             |\n|-------------------------------------|\n| Contextualized alert definition     |\n| Non-contextualized alert definition |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Edit            | Provides a graphical view of the components in the alert definition, with access to each component.

    "## About configuring alert definitions\n*Chapter: View the defined Type for a key*\n*Page: 173*\n\n\nAn alert definition defines the actions that should occur when an event meets defined conditions. The conditions are sometimes configurable.\n\nThe Alerting Frontend interface presents the configurable parts of an alert definition as fields that you can easily configure. For example, here is the form for configuring utilization thresholds for an alert that is related to switch ports.\n\nAn alert definition must be ENABLED for the specified actions to occur.\n",
    "## Components in an alert definition\n*Chapter: View the defined Type for a key*\n*Page: 174*\n\n\nAn alert definition contains at least one entry point filter and one action. It can contain multiple entry points and actions, and optional operations and conditions that change and evaluate data elements in the event data.\n\n## Entry point\n\nThe entry point is the filter defining which events are to be handled by this alert definition. The filter operates on the fields (properties) in the event data.\n\nNOTE: In the alerting process, the event data is normalized into a standard format, but the event is not yet in any database. Therefore, the filter wizard might not be able to prompt you with all valid values. To write a filter, you must research the source of the event and its normalization rules.\n\nHere is an example entry point filter for the Backend Processing Delay alert definition in the System Health folder. The source for this alert is the metric that is called ProcessingDelay collected by the APG\\_Health collector.\n",
    "## Figure 4. Filter in an alert definition\n*Chapter: View the defined Type for a key*\n*Page: 174*\n\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn alert filter typically includes a test for the source of the event.

    "## Figure 5. Operator in an alert definition\n*Chapter: View the defined Type for a key*\n*Page: 175*\n\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conditions\n\nConditions let you set up multiple outcomes in the same alert definition. Each outcome is based on the results from a condition, and would typically have different actions that are associated with them. Two types of conditions are available.\n\n- Comparators let you define value tests. A common technique in Dell SRM is a chain of comparators, each one using a different comparator value. The outcomes are a series of SNMP traps creating Critical, Major, Minor, and finally a Clear Trap, all on the same property, and in the same alert definition.\n- Counters let you count occurrences within a specified time range.\n\nHere is an example comparator that uses Log actions as outcomes. Since the Alert Trap action is missing, events that are processed by this alert definition do not make it into the Events database.\n",
    "## Figure 6. Comparator with two outcome paths\n*Chapter: View the defined Type for a key*\n*Page: 175*\n\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Actions\n\nThe following actions are available:\n\n- An SNMP Alert Trap or Clear Trap, which gets the event into the alerting database or subsequently clears it.\n- A Log action, which writes the event to a log file.\n- A Mail notification, which sends an email to preconfigured email addresses.\n- A Webhook Action, which sends an HTTP/HTTPS POST request to the preconfigured URL. For more information about Webhook, see Dell SRM Alerting Guide.\n- An SNMP trap to a third party, such as another management system.\n\n## NOTE:\n\n- Do not add the Dell Technologies Connectivity Event action to any alert definition.

    "## Contextualized and non-contextualized alert definitions\n*Chapter: View the defined Type for a key*\n*Page: 177*\n\n\nContextualized alert definitions allow for more than one set of configuration values. Different named contexts can be configured differently.\n\nContextualized alert definitions provide the following advantages:\n\n- If future SolutionPack upgrades change the alert definition, the customized parameter settings are not affected because the contexts are saved separately from the alert definition.\n- You can define several contexts, or sets of values, for the same parameter set, and enable or disable the contexts separately. For example, you might have different settings for production and testing, or you might preserve the installed values in the default context and create a context for the customized values.\n\nWhen you configure a contextualized alert definition, you select the context that you are providing values for. You can create and name new contexts.\n\nNon-contextualized alert definitions can have only one set of configuration values.\n",
    "## You can add contextualization to components in an alert definition and set the values for the default context.\n*Chapter: View the defined Type for a key*\n*Page: 174*\n\n\n## About this task\n\nThis procedure describes how to add contextualization to a component in an alert definition This is a one-time process that sets up a component and parameter for contextualization. Thereafter, users can add additional contexts by right-clicking the alert definition and selecting Configure .\n\nMany alert definition components, including all threshold Comparators, are contextualized out of the box. Administrators can use this procedure to contextualize the alert definition components that are not contextualized.\n\nNOTE: The Action components, such as webHooks, traps, logging, and email notifications, do not need to be contextualized. Those configurations are not overwritten.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Right-click the alert definition and choose Edit .\n2. Double-click the component in the alert definition that you want to contextualize. A configuration dialog box appears for the component.\n\n3. Click the small down-arrow next to the configurable element, such as a parameter or filter, and choose Define configuration .\n4. Complete the fields:\n- For Configuration item key label , type a name for this parameter that the user sees on the configuration window.\n- For ordering, optionally select the order in which the parameters appear on the configuration window.\n- For Configuration item key , type a key that is used to uniquely identify the context and reference the context in other contexts within the same alerting definition. For example, an alert definition might have 3 log actions for different conditions. By using a key, you can configure the log action component one time and then reference it in the other components by choosing Configuration Reference when you configure the second and third components.\n- For the last field, type the default configuration that appears in the field when the user adds a context.\n5. Click OK .\n6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for additional parameters in the component.\n7. Click Save below the alert definition whiteboard.\n8. As a best practice, add the first context. Otherwise, the component remains unconfigured.\n- a. Return to the alert definition list, right-click the alert definition, and choose Configure .\n- b. Click Add .\n- c.

    "## Alert definition component reference\n*Chapter: 11. Click Save and enable or Save and disable .*\n*Page: 183*\n\n\nAn alert definition is a sequential set of components that filters events and takes appropriate action. There are four types of alert definition components.\n\n| Entry point filter   | Defines the events and metrics to examine. Every alert definition requires an entry point filter.                                                                                                          |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operations           | Define operational actions on the filtered event data. Operations are optional.                                                                                                                            |\n| Conditions           | Define test conditions on the event data. Different actions can depend on conditional outcomes. Conditions are optional.                                                                                   |\n| Actions              | Define the actions to take, such as creating an SNMP trap to forward to the alerting backend or write a log entry. At least one action component is required for the alert definition to have any results. |\n\n## Entry Point filter\n\nThe Entry Point filter works like report filters in the main user interface.\n\nThe difference between using a filter in the Alerting Frontend and the Backend is the suggestions that are shown in the wizard. The Alerting Backend is not bound to a database, so the list of known properties and values is created at runtime. Because of this, it is normal to have no suggestions when you use the wizard immediately after starting the Alerting Backend.\n\n## Operations\n\nOperations evaluate incoming data to see if they should go to the next component or be dropped.\n\n## No Operation\n\nThis operation does not do anything. Use it if an entry needs separate senders in its process when all the entries come from the same operation, such as a Previous Polling Operation. It is a good way to make a used connector (red) of a grouped box available as an output if needed.\n\n## Case\n\nThis operation creates logical output groups that send data to each next operation until one has its condition met, such as a group of alert levels that send an alert only once for the highest level of alert. The order of criticality of the next components is the order of link creation, so the next component link is the highest level and if its condition is met when the next data is received, the other next components will not receive data.\n\n## Constant Arithmetic\n\nThis operation applies an operator on each entry data with a constant value.\n\nValue\n\nValue that is used by the operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThe arithmetic operator (+, -, / or *)\n\nConstant is left operand\n\nSelect this if the constant value must be the left operand.\n\n## Data Arithmetic\n\nThis operation applies an operator on two data lines that are defined by the filter.\n\n| Operator     | The arithmetic operator (+, -, / or *)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Time limit   | Maximum delta between the two values in minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Left operand | Optional and needed only if you use an operator that produces a different result depending on the order of the operand, such as - and /. This parameter must contain the name of the sender who sends the data that must be the left side of the operation. |\n| Group by     | Properties, each separated by a white space, that create a logical group of values for the operation.                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Value filter | Optional and is necessary only if the entries of this operation come from the same input, as it defines two different elements of the same group.                                                                                                           |\n\n## Constant Math\n\nThis operation applies a complex mathematical operation to the data.\n\n| abs   | The abs function which returns the absolute number.                                         |\n|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ceil  | The ceil function which returns the smallest value but greater than the argument.           |\n| exp   | The exp function which returns the exponential value raised to the power of a double value. |\n\nfloor\n\nThe floor function which returns the largest value but less than the argument.\n\n## Configurable Math\n\nThis operation applies a complex mathematical operation using a parameter to the data.\n\nOperation\n\nThe mathematical operation\n\nValue\n\nValue applied to the second parameter of the selected operation\n\n## History Operation\n\nThis sliding window operation collects a range of values bounded by the number of values or the time range of the values.

Since most of the time they are coming from the Watch4net collectors, they are the same properties that you find when editing a report. When the Alerting Backend is running, you can have a view of those properties either in an entry point filter or when probing an active definition.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to send an email reporting the current CPU utilization for a specific CPU in a device based on the alert data below:\n\n```\nAlertData: { VALUE: 25 TMST: 123456789 (unix timestamps) ID: uniqueId for this metric properties: { devtype: Array device: VPLEX1 parttype: CPU part: CPU0 name: CurrentUtilization } }\n```\n\nYou would add the following as the content of the email message:\n\n```\nDevice PROP.'device' currently has a PROP.'name' on its PROP.'part' of VALUE.\n```\n\nThis would translate dynamically as:\n\n```\nDevice VPLEX1 currently has a CurrentUtilization on its CPU0 of 25.\n```\n\n## Log action\n\nThis action writes an entry in a log file. If two actions write to the same file, use the same parameters except for the content, because the Alerting Backend cannot guarantee which configuration is used. The default directory for the log files is Backends/ Alerting-Backend/Default/logs.\n",

Alert definition components can reference a template. Log and Traps are the most frequently used actions in alert definitions. We provide a log template and two trap templates.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. To view an example alert definition:\n- a. From the Alerting page, click Alert definitions &gt; Examples .\n- b. In the right pane, right-click an alert definition name and select Edit .\n2. To view a preconfigured template:\n- a. From the Alerting page, click Templates &gt; template\\_name .\n- b. Review and edit the template contents before associating it to alert definitions.\n3. To edit the default trap templates to work in your environment:\n- a. From the Alerting page, click Templates &gt; default trap template .\n- b. In the Template Parameters section, examine the Trap Content field.\n\nThe preconfigured trap template lists all possible alert properties, including some properties that are user-defined. It is probable that your MIB does not contain fields for the entire list of properties. In that case, any SNMP trap action component that references the default alert trap template does not work.\n\n- c. Replace any property in the list that does not exist in your MIB with the value null .\n\nThe order of properties is important in a template.\n\nNOTE: To preserve the out-of-the-box template for future use, create a template with an edited list of properties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHere is an example edited property list.\n\nPROP.'id',PROP.'Name', null ,PROP.'count',PROP.'eventstate',PROP.'Source',PROP.'parttype ',PROP.'part',PROP.'eventname',PROP.'parttypedisplayname',PROP.'partdisplayname',PROP.

Click Save .\n4. To associate a template to an SNMP trap action:\n- a. Under Alert Definitions , click an alert definition folder.\n- b. In the table in the right pane, right-click the alert definition name and select Edit . The diagram of components for this alert opens.\n- c. Click the Edit (pencil) icon above the SNMP trap action component (a green circle).\n- d. In the Edit Component dialog box that opens, in the Template field, select the appropriate template name from the drop-down list.\n",
    "## Setting up a log template\n*Chapter: 11. Click Save and enable or Save and disable .*\n*Page: 194*\n\n\nThis example shows creating a template based on the Log template. Logs are frequently used actions in alert definitions.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. From the Alerting page, expand Templates .\n2. Click Log Template .\n3. In Description , type a description for the new template.\n4. In File prefix , type the directory path and prefix for each log file. The log files are created in the Alerting-Backend/instance/Alerts folder and named log\\_INDEX.log, where index is\n\nincremented until it reaches the log retention limit. The newest log files have the lowest index, and the current log is the 0 log.\n\n5. In Logs retention , type the number for how many logs you want to keep.\n6. In Rotation time , type a value for the maximum time in minutes that log data is gathered before the log is created. This value is optional if you are setting a value for rotation entries. In this example, the logs files are rotated once a day (1440\n\nminutes).\n\n7. In Rotation entries , type a value for the maximum number of entries per log file. This value is optional if you are setting a rotation time. In this example, the log is rotated when the 0 log file has 5000 entries.\n8. In Entry content , type the properties for the log entry. To add the value, date or ID of the current data, use the keywords VALUE, TMST, or ID. To add a property of the current\n\ndata, use the keyword PROP.'propertyName'. In this example, each line of the log contains: DEVICE with PART -&gt; NAME = VALUE.\n\n9. Click Save .\n",
    "## Setting up a trap notify and trap clear template\n*Chapter: 11. Click Save and enable or Save and disable .*\n*Page: 194*\n\n\nThis example shows how to create a template based on the Trap Notify template. Traps are frequently used actions in alert definitions. A Trap Notify alert sends an alert to your fault management system. The Trap Clear deactivates the alert.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. From the Alerting page, expand Templates .\n2. Click Trap Notify Template .\n\n3. In Description , type a description for the new template.\n4. In Host , type the host that receives the traps.\n\nThe host is the address of the SNMP trap manager and should be changed if it is not on the same host as the alerting backend.\n\n5. In Port , type the trap manager port.162 is the default for this protocol.\n6. In Community , type the trap community. Public is the default.\n7. In Generic ID , type the generic ID of the trap.\n8. In Enterprise specific ID , type the specific ID of the trap format for the generic type.\n9. In Trap content , type the content for each variable of the trap, which is separated by commas.\n\nCommas are escaped if they are preceded by a \\. To add the value, date or ID of the current data, use the keywords VALUE, TMST, or ID. To add a property of the current data, use the keyword PROP.'propertyName'. Dell Technologies recommends that you do not change the content of the traps as the order of the properties match our trap configuration. You can change the last three properties to ones you define. The only difference between Trap Notify and Trap Clear is the number value in the Trap content: 2 is notified and 4 is clear.\n\n10. Click Save .\n\n## Grouped boxes\n\nGrouped boxes are containers of standard alerting components, which are linked in the same way as alert definitions, that you can use in an alert definition or other grouped boxes.\n\nWith grouped boxes that you can:\n\n- Create a subset of boxes such as baseline computations that you can reuse in multiple definitions. Grouped Boxes can contain any alert definition component and can easily be reused.\n- Create a single box that has its instances that are updated whenever it is modified, unlike templates that do not have a link. When you make a change to a grouped box, the change is immediately propagated to all the alert definitions that use it.\n\nUnlike alert definitions, which are grouped boxes have free inputs and outputs on any number of components, whether they are linked or not. The free connectors appear as inputs or outputs on the group box that you can use to link to other components. You can hover over a free connector to see its source component, which is its name, and the input/output type, for example Condition met output.\n\nGrouped boxes are created like alert definitions with these exceptions:\n\n- Entry points are not required to save a grouped box.\n- Connectors have three possible states: red, yellow, and green.\n- When you save a grouped box, the resulting box in the definitions is a red box and its connectors are the unused input/ output connectors of its internal components. No configuration is needed when using a grouped box in a definition. The description of the configuration is the description that you type when you save the grouped box.\n",
    "## Creating a Grouped Box\n*Chapter: 11. Click Save and enable or Save and disable .*\n*Page: 195*\n\n\nYou can create and edit Grouped Boxes and use them in alert definitions. Grouped Boxes can contain any alert definition component and can be easily reused.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. From the Alerting page, click Grouped boxes .\n2. Click the New element icon above the tree.\n3. Edit the Grouped Box definition by dragging entry points, operations, conditions and actions on the page, and editing their parameters. Unlike alert definitions, entry points are not mandatory for grouped boxes.\n4. Link the components in a logical flow for how you want the data to be evaluated.\n\nConnectors have three states:\n\nGreen represents free input or output connectors. You can link within the scope of the Grouped Box you are working on or leave the connector free, in which case it appears as a free connector on the Grouped Box when it is used in an Alert Definition.\n\nRed represents a connector that is linked with another element within the Grouped Box. The data flow between these connectors takes place in the Grouped Box, and the connectors are not visible and cannot be linked to in the Grouped Box.\n\nYellow represents connectors that have been used within an Alert Definition. You can hover over a yellow connector and see a list of the alert definitions that use it, including the component that links to it. A yellow connector cannot be linked to in the source Grouped Box as it is already occupied in one or more Alert Definitions, and it cannot be deleted until it is freed in the Alert Definitions it is linked to.\n\nYou can use a Grouped Box within another Grouped Box but not within itself. Grouped Boxes that are used within a Grouped Box display their available connectors.\n\n5. Click Save .\n\n## Probing alerts\n\nProbing helps you confirm the behavior of an alert definition. Do a probe to test the elements in an alert definition in real time to see how data is evaluated at each component, and how many times actions have been triggered.\n\nProbes help you spot problems with how you construct your alert definitions, so that you can adjust them and retest until your alerts are satisfactory. This helps you to construct ever more complex alerts to match the increasing complexity of your network.\n\nProbing is available only to users who have write permission.\n\n## Preparing for probing\n\nBefore you start probing, you can make these changes to improve the success of probing your alert definitions.\n\n- Ensure the alerting sources, such as timeseries, events, text, or report data, are correctly configured to be sent to the Alerting Backend.\n- Reduce the polling intervals of one or more collectors, or how often source data is sent to an Alerting Backend, so that your probing yields more results that correspond to the timeframe. If, for example, the default polling for the Smarts Collector uses four minutes, you would have to wait four minutes for every probe result. You can change the Smarts Collector to 10 seconds for the duration of the probing, and then switch it back for production.\n- Reduce the sampling property that determines how many properties per data sample are preserved. This is controlled by the alerting.suggestion.sample property in the module.properties file that is located at &lt;APG&gt;/Backends/AlertingBackend/&lt;instance&gt;/conf . By default this property does not appear, and 1 in 100 properties are kept. For example if polling takes place every 10 seconds, it can take a long time to accumulate enough properties for effective probing. You can change this to 1:1 for the duration of your probing session.\n- Filter hints and sampled properties are dependent on the data coming into the Alerting Backend. You can increase the number of hints and sampled properties by adding and adjusting the alerting.suggestion.sampling property in the module.properties file that is located in the conf directory of the Alerting Backend.\n",

To disable the Probe UI, for example to edit the definition to refine the probe results, click anywhere in the tree, and then click the alert definition you were working with. From here, you can edit it.\n\n## Probing a report\n\nYou can test how a report is alerted on. This procedure has three major steps: set up a scheduled report to be alerted on and generate it, create an alerting definition for the report, and probe the alert definition.\n\n## About this task\n\nNotes about report probe results:\n\n- Some components, such entry points and operations, may be less interesting to probe, as they return only their descriptions and settings.\n- Actions, besides listing all their settings, show the number of times they have been executed. You can see in real time the effect the report data had on the number of times the action that is executed by watching this number during the probing session.\n- Enabling links displays the information in each line of alert data according to the selections in the Probe window. Since there is no filter that all data is parsed and every property with its value appears. Depending on where the link is located in the alert definition, a subset of alerting data lines appear according to how they are routed from previous components in the chain.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Set up a scheduled report to be alerted on and generate it:\n- a. In the main user interface, browse to a report that contains alerting data.\n- b. Using the Display menu, set the range to 1 month.\n- c. Using the Tools menu, select Schedule this Report .\n- d. Set the schedule to Every month .\n- e. Click the Alert tab and select the Alerting Backend that contains the alert definitions to test with the data from this scheduled report.\n- f. In the tree, click Scheduled Reports , right-click the report, and then click Launch now .\n- g. The Report Data Adapter, which parses reports from the Frontend, is automatically created the first time that it receives a report from the Frontend to be alerted on. The Report Data Adapter is named AUTO\\_CREATED\\_APG\\_REPORT\\_ADAPTER. On the Alerting interface, change its Time check parameter to 1 (minute), so that reports that are received from the Frontend are parsed and can be probed. You can change this back to a larger interval after the alert definitions are ready for production, to reduce the load on the server that is caused by needless polling.\n2. Create an alerting definition for the report:\n- a. On the Alerting Frontend, click Alert Definitions &gt; Examples &gt; Multiple Severities Comparator and above the tree click the Copy and then the Paste icon. Rename it Utilization Over Month Alert.\n- b. Click the newly created alert definition in the tree to display its components.\n- c. Mouse over its entry point and click the pen icon to edit it.\n\n- d. In the Edit Components dialog box that appears, delete the contents of the filter. You can change its name and description.\n- e. You can add a filter later, but first test the unfiltered content using a probe, and include a filter from the Probe UI for iterative testing purposes. Alert definitions pass their data to the next component only if the state data has changed from a previous data line in a series. This is useful, for example, if instead of using the Report Data Adapter, you use the Values Socket Listener Adapter to directly input UtilizationPct metric data about the file systems that are received by the Smarts-Collector through the Collector-Manager, and do not want to continually trigger an alert when a file system is over a certain value, but only is parsed the first time it crosses the threshold, and subsequently when it is under the threshold. In this example, the report is parsed once a month and all the data are parsed to see which thresholds are crossed for each line of alerting data. Therefore, edit each Comparator condition to enable their Stateless check boxes.\n- f. Save and enable the alert definition.\n- g. To ensure the Report Data Adapter named AUTO\\_CREATED\\_APG\\_REPORT\\_ADAPTER is enabled, click it in the adapter list and click Enable . You can disable any other adapters so that you can concentrate on the report data being received from the APG Frontend, if this does not impact other required running alerts.\n3. Probe the alert definition:\n- a. From the Alerting page, click Alert Definitions .\n- b. Click Utilization Over Month Alert &gt; Probe . The alert definition appears with the Probe window on the left, and space at the bottom of the screen for the probe results.\n- c. Enable a few of the components and links of the alert definition to see the data flowing through them by clicking each one.\n\nFor each component or link clicked, a probe result window appears at the bottom of the screen.\n\n- d. Open up another browser window, return to the main user interface and on the Scheduled Reports Management page, right-click the scheduled report you configured to be alerted on and click Launch now .\n",

Data from a report that is scheduled for alerting is converted into XML form and then parsed into alerting data by the APG Report Data adapter. Report Data Adapter has a default time to check for generated xml file to 60 minutes. You can also configure the time check value to the required value.\n\nThe alerting data is sent to the Alerting Backend, where the alert definitions evaluate the alerting data. This alerting method depends on an alert definition that filters on the report name and one or more report metric names. The alert definition defines the conditions that generate an alert, such as a value that is exceeded.\n\nYou can evaluate any metric that appears on the report. You can also use operations in the alert definition to create a new metric value from the data on the report, and generate alerts on the calculated value.\n\n## Prerequisites for creating alerts from scheduled reports\n\nTo alert on reports, all the following elements must be in place.\n\n- The Alerting Frontend and the Alerting Backend must be configured as described in Configure the alerting engine.\n- Communication between the APG Frontend and the Alerting Backend must be configured if they are on different servers. See Configure alerting communication.\n- An APG Report Data Adapter must be defined in the Alerting Frontend. This adapter is created automatically the first time a report is parsed by alerting.\n- Alert definitions must exist in the Alerting Frontend to gather data from the reports. The procedure Create a scheduled report alert includes how to create the appropriate alert definition.\n",

The connector should look like this:\n\n```\n<!-- This collecting component connects the collecting process to the Alerting itself, using a plain text socket. --> <connector enabled=\"false\" name=\"Alerting\" conf=\"Collector-Manager/Default/CacheConnector/conf /alertingconnector.xml\" />\n```\n\nThe file alertingconnector.xml creates a socket on port 2010, which is the listening port of the default APG Values Socket Listener adapter of the Alerting Backend. By enabling both the connector and the adapter, Alerting can trigger on APG values.\n",
    "## Configure alerting communication\n*Chapter: 11. Click Save and enable or Save and disable .*\n*Page: 199*\n\n\nIf the APG Frontend and the Alerting Frontend are not on the same server, add lines to the APG.xml file so that the Frontend knows which Alerting Backend instances it can send reports to.\n\n## About this task\n\nThis procedure assumes that the APG Frontend and the Alerting Frontend and Backend are configured.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. On the server where the Alerting Frontend resides, open alerting-frontend.xml, at &lt;APG&gt;/Web-Servers/Tomcat/ &lt;Instance&gt;/conf/Catalina/localhost .\n2. Copy the alerting properties.\n\nFor example, if you have two Alerting Backends configured, you copy these lines:\n\n```\n<Resource name=\"manager/Local Manager\" auth=\"Container\" type=\"com.watch4net.alerting.jmx.AlertManagerFactory\" factory=\"org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory\" user=\"admin\" pass=\"changeme\" url=\"service:jmx:rmi:/ //jndi/rmi://localhost:52569/jmxrmi\" /> <Resource name=\"manager/Second Manager\" auth=\"Container\"\n```\n\n```\ntype=\"com.watch4net.alerting.jmx.AlertManagerFactory\" factory=\"org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory\" user=\"admin\" pass=\"changeme\" url=\"service:jmx:rmi:/ //jndi/rmi://localhost:52570/jmxrmi\" />\n```\n\n3. On the server where the Alerting Frontend resides, open APG.xml, at &lt;APG&gt;/Web-Servers/Tomcat/&lt;Instance&gt;/ conf/Catalina/localhost and paste the lines that you copied from the alerting-frontend.xml file anywhere in the &lt;context&gt; tags.\n4. If the Alerting Frontend references the local Alerting Backend, replace localhost in each copied entry with the IP address of the Alerting Backend.\n5. Restart Tomcat.\n",
    "## Create a scheduled report alert\n*Chapter: 11. Click Save and enable or Save and disable .*\n*Page: 200*\n\n\nTo configure alerts from scheduled report data, perform the following steps:\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Schedule the report for alerting:\n- a. On the Console, browse to the report that has the metric you want to alert on and click Tools &gt; Schedule this report .\n- b. On the Scheduling tab, define how often and when to run this report.\n- c. On the Alert tab, select Local Manager .\n- d. Click Save .\n2. Enable the APG Report Data Adapter.\n- a. Go to Administration &gt; CONFIG &gt; Alerts &gt; Adapters .\n- b. Look for APG Report Data adapter. If it is in the list of adapters, use the table in the right pane to ensure it is enabled.\n\nIf the adapter is not listed, perform the following step.\n\n3. (One-time step) Add the APG Report Data adapter:\n- a. On the User Console, go to My Reports &gt; Scheduled Reports .\n- b. In the right pane, right-click the report that you scheduled for alerting, and choose Launch now .\n\nThis action adds the APG Report Data adapter to the list of adapters if it is not already there, and enables it.\n\n4. Create an alert definition that includes:\n- a. A filter that identifies the report name and one or more metrics.\n- 'reportname== report name '\n- 'name== metric name '\n- b. Conditions that evaluate the metric and define outcome paths. You can optionally include operations that create new metric values from the entry metric data.\n- c. To make the alert appear in alerting reports, include SNMP Alert Trap and Clear Trap actions on the outcome paths. Other actions are also valid, such as log, email, or SNMP notifications.\n5. Enable the alert definition.\n6. Launch the report again, or wait for the next scheduled run.\n\nEach time the report runs, the Alerting Backend receives the data and generates or clears alerts when conditions in the alert definition are met.\n\nYou can use probing to simulate conditions and test the results.\n\n## Report data parsing\n\nThe APG Report Data adapter parses the data in the scheduled reports that it receives.\n\nThe APG Report Data adapter generates alerting data from scheduled reports. The data and related properties depend on the report type.\n\nEach data point in a report, such as a point in a graph or a table row with a value column, results in a line of data that can be evaluated by an alert definition.\n\n## Common properties\n\nEach line of alerting data output by the APG Report Data adapter has the following properties.\n\nTimestamp Value Name ReportName\n\nThe displayed properties with their values from the header of the report are included with the lines of alerting data from the report. If it is a mixed report, the lines of alerting data from each child report have these common properties, although usually properties are used only in individual reports for a single device.\n\n## Tables\n\nEach row of a table report results in one line of alerting data per value column that can be evaluated by an alert definition.\n\n- The value column of the table is used for alert definition evaluation, unless something else is specified for evaluation, such as a field in a string operation.\n- The column name of the value column is used as the property value of the name property. The name is what the report editor named the column.\n- Data from other table columns are input as additional properties, with their column names used as the property names. The name is what the report editor named the column.\n\n## Graphs\n\nIn a standard time-series graph, each timestamp (point on the graph), generates a line of alert data that can be evaluated. In a graph with four lines (metrics), at each timestamp there are four lines of data.\n\nThe value of the property name is derived from the legend, even if the legend is hidden as it is in Mixed Reports.\n\nFor horizontal bar and pie charts, each category in the graph results in a line of alerting data that contains the following information:\n\n- Relative value in percentage of the metric compared to the other categories.\n- Value of the name property, which is the name of the report.\n- Timestamp of each line of alerting data, which, for these types of reports, corresponds to the time when the report was generated instead of the period of time that the report covers. Do not use these types of reports for time-based alerting.\n- Section property for each line of alerting data, which corresponds to the legend for the category reported on in the data.\n- The absoluteValue, which is the absolute value of the metric for the category for the report period.\n- The totalValue, which is the sum of the absolute values for every category in the graph.\n\n## Baseline graphs\n\nBaseline graphs are like other time series graphs with these additional characteristics:\n\n- One alerting data line is created for each timestamp with the value of the metric and its name, according to the contents of the legend, using the value of the name property.\n- The baselineValue property is added, which is an average for the metric at the specified time over the last month.\n- The baselineMin is added, which is the minimum value that is recorded for the metric at the specified time over the last month.\n- The baselineMax is added, which is the maximum value that is recorded for the metric at the specified time over the last month.\n\nYou can use a formula to vary the length of the baseline instead of using the default, which is the past 4 weeks.\n\n## Documentation Feedback\n\nDell Technologies strives to provide accurate and comprehensive documentation and welcomes your suggestions and comments.
